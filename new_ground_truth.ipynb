       "      <td>erection maintenance is caused by connective tissue weakness as well as lymphatic stagnation of the area and accompanying channels  a proper detoxification is necessary to reverse the stagnation and get things flowing againlower circulation and pituitary might also be indicatedmedical will likely not recommend anything useful in the long term pharmaceuticals do not solve a problem only suppress it and it will return again later and worse than beforecertain herbal protocols and natural protocols would be very warranted in getting things going again | first step always is to do a medical rule out so that youre sure the problem is psychological and emotion based not a medical condition which requires care and attentionif you are medically clear in the reasons for losing your erection then reflect on what may be creating a loss in confidence in either who you are and what youre doing with your life or whether your wife has these sort of problems within herselfoften a problem transfers ownership of who shows itif you are a sensitive person its possible your erection problem reflects your wifes insecurities and selfdoubt  if she is someone who is reluctant to talk about feeling unsure then in a certain way by you showing a problem she can avoid looking at herselfthere may not be a direct cause such as usually exists in a medical problemmedicine looks for symptoms to treatour emotional lives are much more indirectif you feel stress at work or are unhappy in the place you live for example then your frustration may show up in your sex lifebasically do a broad inward search of your life and what it holds and maybe ask your wife to do the sameyou may clear the air within yourselves and between each other so the problem goes away | when im working with men with this type of situation i always suggest a medical examination to rule out any type of organic reason for a difficulty in maintaining interaction in cases where there is no medical reason for the loss of erection i find that many men have a similar situation in experiencing negative intrusive thinking during lovemaking my counseling approach for this situation is to incorporate the use of mindful sex | assuming there are no medical explanations for this issue many men ive worked with on this come to see it as essentially a form of anxiety there is a phenomenon called the yerkes dodson law see below source wikipedia which basically states that if we feel either too much or too little stress pressure or nervousness about a task it will adversely impact our ability to do carry it out successfully the ideal amount of stressarousal is right in the middle  not too little and not too much this applies to more things than we might often realize  from giving a presentation to ordering food to making a free throw to driving to sexual intimacy as in this case a common suggestion that many men find helpful is initiating open and honest conversations with their partners about this issue and for a temporary period of time agreeing to physical intimacy and sexual pleasure in other forms and without the expectation of intercourse there are many ways to go about that which are outside the scope of this blog article but this can be a path to connecting intimately and renewing physical bonding without unhelpful anxiety  and over time can lead back to intimacy in all the ways that have become elusive best of luck | if you havent already please see a doctor  ed can be caused by any number of physical conditions and you need to get checked out  once you have ruled out any physical issues that interfere with getting an  erection its time to look for more subtle causes  unfortunately you may have gotten yourself into a mind set of i hope i can but what if i cant  which is certain to interfere with performanceagain rule out physical causes can you tell i think thats important then talk with your wife about working  together to find the right approach  it might be a good idea for example to take the pressure off by enjoying each other without intercourse  you can have great sex without penetration and you can have physical intimacy without sex so slow down and experiment  you might find more pleasure than you expect when you can relax knowing there doesnt have to be a finish lineagain yes the  third time see a doctor just in case theres something going  on  once you get the all clear find joy and spontaneity with your wife again by being creative and pressure free | for starters know that this is a normal experience for many men at some point in their lives while this can certainly cause some embarrassment a diminished sexual esteem or relationship problems it is important to know you are not alone i am going to move forward assuming that you have already checked with a medical professional to rule out any medical problems that may be related to this assuming that is the case for most this happens for two primary reasons it is either a short term biological shortage of blood flow to the penis this can be caused my diet lack of exercise even stress another primary reason for loss of erections are anxiety have their been recent relationship issues are you feeling as though you arent satisfied in the bedroom these are just a few aspects that can cause subconscious anxiety and loss of erection my suggestion to you would be to seek out a counselor that specializes in sexuality that can assist you in moving forward with this  best of luck</td>\n",

       "4  a friend of mine taking psychology advised i go to my doctor to check if i have major depressive disorder im afraid of the consequences of doing so if i do become diagnosed with major depressive disorder wont that go on my records i will never be able to become a counselor along with a list of other things i may be prohibited from im also afraid of taking any antidepressants this year my doctor gave me some for a dislocated hip i had a severe reaction and passed out moments after taking them everyone i know who has taken antidepressants says its a bad idea all around and youre better getting treatment without them im concerned they might take me to a clinic and force me to take medication because i am unable to make decisions on my own im not really suicidal but i am not really taking care of myself either someone also told me they still use electroshock therapy im not keen on that im wondering if i am better off just getting selfhelp and working things out on my own its just that ive been an emotional mess since i was in elementary school ive graduated now and tried to stay positive and be happy but i cannot deny i still am not good   \n",

has these sort of problems within herselfoften a problem transfers ownership of who shows itif you are a sensitive person its possible your erection problem reflects your wifes insecurities and

       "3  erection maintenance is caused by connective tissue weakness as well as lymphatic stagnation of the area and accompanying channels  a proper detoxification is necessary to reverse the

only suppress it and it will return again later and worse than beforecertain herbal protocols and natural protocols would be very warranted in getting things going again | first step always is to do a

the loss of erection i find that many men have a similar situation in experiencing negative intrusive thinking during lovemaking my counseling approach for this situation is to incorporate the use of mindful sex | assuming there are no medical explanations for this issue many men ive worked with on this come to see it as essentially a form of anxiety there is a phenomenon called the yerkes dodson law see below source wikipedia which basically states that if we feel either too much or too little stress pressure or nervousness about a task it will adversely impact our ability to do carry it out successfully the ideal amount of stressarousal is right in the middle  not too little and not too much this applies to more things than we might often realize  from giving a presentation to ordering food to making a free throw to driving to sexual intimacy as in this case a common suggestion that many men find helpful is initiating open and honest conversations with their partners about this issue and for a temporary period of time agreeing to physical intimacy and sexual pleasure in other forms and without the expectation of intercourse there are many ways to go about that which are outside the scope of this blog article but this can be a path to connecting intimately and renewing physical bonding without unhelpful anxiety  and over time can lead back to intimacy in all the ways that have become elusive best of luck | if you havent already please see a doctor  ed can be caused by any number of physical conditions and you need to get checked out  once you have ruled out any physical issues that interfere with getting an  erection its time to look for more subtle causes  unfortunately you may have gotten yourself into a mind set of i hope i can but what if i cant  which is certain to interfere with performanceagain rule out physical causes can you tell i think thats important then talk with your wife about working  together to find the right approach  it might be a good idea for example to take the pressure off by enjoying each other without intercourse  you can have great sex without penetration and you can have physical intimacy without sex so slow down and experiment  you might find more pleasure than you expect when you can relax knowing there doesnt have to be a finish lineagain yes the  third time see a doctor just in case theres something going  on  once you get the all clear find joy and spontaneity with your wife again by being creative and pressure free | for starters know that this is a normal experience for many men at some point in their

and being in touch with your own views are signs of strength and clarity in a personas a therapist i always tell my patients to avoid antidepressantstheir effectiveness is in suppressing a persons mood and feelings  if someone does not know how they are feeling then they will have more difficulty in understanding themselves their uncertainties and hesitations and overall how they relate to others and what they expect from othersantidepressants mask how someone feelsin a crisis temporarily taking antidepressants may be helpful  if someone is so overwhelmed that they are not functioning then  suppressing unhappy feelings so that the person can get through a day may be of benefit for a short whilebasically respect and follow your own opinion about antidepressants   your view is shared by many   it is a minority opinion and very valid if you would like to shop for a therapist ask the person on the phone what their opinions are about antidepressantsideally you will eventually find a therapist who thinks in a way which is similar to you or at least similar enough that you will have a sense that you are able to trust working with them on whatever you define as problematici hope you will have an easy and productive therapist search   \n",
