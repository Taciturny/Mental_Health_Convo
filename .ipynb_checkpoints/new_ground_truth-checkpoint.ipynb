       "      <td>sometimes relationships just do not work  dont feel that the first second or even third relationship is the relationship you are suppose to be in for life   the one that is meant for you will require work but should be be draining and a constant roller coaster of breaking up  it is good you all went to counseling but one or two sessions may not be enough to make and see a change in behavior  it takes times and it takes both working toward the same goal  i would suggest doing youmeaning focusing on your own growth at the time  if he wants to grow with you he will make the necessary steps  if he doesntwish him well | from what you write youre not too happy with how your boyfriend treats you and how he handles his own lifewhat keeps you feeling connected to him in positive waysif youre truly not happy most of the time in this relationship then youre at the time of asking why youd want to remain in a relationship which is draining | hello and thank you for your question i worked for a number of years with people who have been both abused in their relationships and those who have been abusive being involved in a relationship with a partner who does the behaviors you describe can be incredibly difficult and many would argue is even harder than overcoming actual physical violence i was a little confused about whether youre are still broken up with this person or if you are still thinking about it i am going to assume you are still undecided some of the things you are describing sound like emotional abuse even without physical abuse being emotionally abused can still be traumatizing when partners question and accuse they are often trying to exercise power and control over their partners by hurting them with unfounded accusations  the accusations serve to make someone feel guilty and to manipulate them for example if your partner accuses you of cheating when you go out bowling with friends you may elect not to go bowling just to satisfy your partner and prevent a fight from occurring the person being accused or questioned often tries to prove over and over again that they have done nothing wrong but it doesnt matter and that brings me to the point of what some people who experience these behaviors do in order to start feeling like they have some power again here are just a few things1 they realize there is no right answer trying to be logical with someone who doesnt want to be logical doesnt work many people simply stop trying to defend themselves against false accusations because there was no answer that would satisfy their partner anyway in addition the rules of the relationship seem to change on a daily basis and what may be okay with your partner one day may make them angry the next and this can leave people constantly feeling like they are on eggshells  2 the find support finding a support group or a group of people who remind you on a daily basis that you are a decent person is always a good idea one of the things that can happen when we are with someone who does emotionally abusive things is begin to have a negative concept of ourselves surrounding yourself with people who remind you that you are a good person is a great idea 3 they reinvest in themselves try to find some time for yourself this couldnt possibly sound more cliché but it is actually true whether that is taking up a new hobby or doing an old one one thing that can happen when emotional abuse takes place in a relationship is the person being abused can begin to isolate and not do the things that make them enjoy life taking some time for the self can sometimes bring things into perspectivei dont know if you are still in counseling but if you are and you are getting what you need then that is great if not there are others you can try its important to find the right fit as for the question of whether or not you should leave your partner that is a question that can only be answered by you but you could ask yourself some questions  like these to help you decide1 what are some of my values about relationships do i want trust honesty ask yourself if you have these things in your relationship2 do i feel like this relationship brings out the best in me or does it seem to bring me down3 if i want to stay in this relationship what are some specific things that need to change hope some of these suggestions help good luck to you be wellrobin landwehr dbh lpc ncc</td>\n",

       "70   sometimes relationships just do not work  dont feel that the first second or even third relationship is the relationship you are suppose to be in for life   the one that is meant for you will require work but should be be draining and a constant roller coaster of breaking up  it is good you all went to counseling but one or two sessions may not be enough to make and see a change in behavior  it takes times and it takes both working toward the same goal  i would suggest doing youmeaning focusing on your own growth at the time  if he wants to grow with you he will make the necessary steps  if he doesntwish him well | from what you write youre not too happy with how your boyfriend treats you and how he handles his own lifewhat keeps you feeling connected to him in positive waysif youre truly not happy most of the time in this relationship then youre at the time of asking why youd want to remain in a relationship which is draining | hello and thank you for your question i worked for a number of years with people who have been both abused in their relationships and those who have been abusive being involved in a relationship with a partner who does the behaviors you describe can be incredibly difficult and many would argue is even harder than overcoming actual physical violence i was a little confused about whether youre are still broken up with this person or if you are still thinking about it i am going to assume you are still undecided some of the things you are describing sound like emotional abuse even without physical abuse being emotionally abused can still be traumatizing when partners question and accuse they are often trying to exercise power and control over their partners by hurting them with unfounded accusations  the accusations serve to make someone feel guilty and to manipulate them for example if your partner accuses you of cheating when you go out bowling with friends you may elect not to go bowling just to satisfy your partner and prevent a fight from occurring the person being accused or questioned often tries to prove over and over again that they have done nothing wrong but it doesnt matter and that brings me to the point of what some people who experience these behaviors do in order to start feeling like they have some power again here are just a few things1 they realize there is no right answer trying to be logical with someone who doesnt want to be logical doesnt work many people simply stop trying to defend themselves against false accusations because there was no answer that would satisfy their partner anyway in addition the rules of the relationship seem to change on a daily basis and what may be okay with your partner one day may make them angry the next and this can leave people constantly feeling like they are on eggshells  2 the find support finding a support group or a group of people who remind you on a daily basis that you are a decent person is always a good idea one of the things that can happen when we are with someone who does emotionally abusive things is begin to have a negative concept of ourselves surrounding yourself with people who remind you that you are a good person is a great idea 3 they reinvest in themselves try to find some time for yourself this couldnt possibly sound more cliché but it is actually true whether that is taking up a new hobby or doing an old one one thing that can happen when emotional abuse takes place in a relationship is the person being abused can begin to isolate and not do the things that make them enjoy life taking some time for the self can sometimes bring things into perspectivei dont know if you are still in counseling but if you are and you are getting what you need then that is great if not there are others you can try its important to find the right fit as for the question of whether or not you should leave your partner that is a question that can only be answered by you but you could ask yourself some questions  like these to help you decide1 what are some of my values about relationships do i want trust honesty ask yourself if you have these things in your relationship2 do i feel like this relationship brings out the best in me or does it seem to bring me down3 if i want to stay in this relationship what are some specific things that need to change hope some of these suggestions help good luck to you be wellrobin landwehr dbh lpc ncc   \n",
