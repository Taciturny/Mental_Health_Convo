signs of depression and stress


hello. lets say i have a conversation data context and responses from HF. Now, how  if i have a basic prompt format for the llm, how will the llm know how to answer the questions just by the prompt alone. also context or responses differ..so even if i take just one context, its not enough and may differ from others. so what can we do?


export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:C:/Users/USER/Desktop/Mental_Health_Convo/Mental_Hea (do this first)

Given this py file with Class, create an app.py, monitor_app.py, database.py and another py file with. 
Create a user app (app.py) for a user to input his mental question and feedback. The user app should be intrigung and engaging
monitor app is to monitor the metrics..(use as many metrics, as you can as a professional)
database (postgresql) for creating the tables; conversations, feedback, search types, model types, get_response_type_stats, get_model_performance_stats, get_user_engagement_stats, and other metrics (as a professional)
the other file should be the backend (or under the hood).
i want responses that will be short and long. And the user may not know about search types or model types. So the backend should be able to know the model and search type. Use gpt2-medium to answer the short response while the others should be the long response (gpt-neo-1.3B). Also, only the best response (just 1) should show. So create a format or code that will choose the best response from the search and llm. Also both the quetion (from the user) and response (from search/llm) should be in English. Create a prompt for the llm that is empathic and caring (as a professional, create it). Finally, let the response not be weird and off-point. 


dataset link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/marmikpandya/mental-health
okay the shape of my data is 12598 after cleaning...i will like to ingest it to weaviate but in batches...how many batches pls



hello. For my RAG project for a course, i want you as a professional, to give me either 1 or 2 vector database(s), which i will use to store my vectors, index and embeddings. My data is about 10k rows of data (id, question and answer). NB: I want the database to help in retrieval (search, keyword, vector and hybrid). Finally, i will create a streamlit app to monitor the project by creating a user UI and may eventually deploy on cloud (either streamlit cloud or AWS EC2 (its under probability)). In essence i want a V database that will be compatible (I have tried Weaviate and Milvus (which the former worked locally but dont if it will work in the cloud and the latter needs a standalone which only works in linux; i have windows os), then i tried faiss which saved the embeddings and index locally and it took spcae. Unless there is an alternative to save the data in a Vdb). Pls help me out. I have less than one week to complete and submit. Thanks




Given this py file with Class, create an app.py, monitor_app.py, database.py and any other py files (as a professional), the app.py should be the main app (streamlit) where user input his mental health query and there will be a response and feedback (make it intriguing and empathic; also spice it up and can give mental health tips), monitor app is to monitor the user app's conversations and feedbacks, search types, model types and any other thing you think we should monitor. database.py should store them. Now, question, can we use postgreql or qdrant? I used the latter to save my vectors/embeddings, creating the tables; conversations, feedback, search types, model types, get_response_type_stats, get_model_performance_stats, get_user_engagement_stats, and other metrics (as a professional). so when a user ask a question, the search and llm should give the best response out of all; find a way to do that. And the user may not know about search types or model types. so just think of how you can adjust it professionally. here are the code



Certainly. Let's break down the approach and then discuss the potential use of MentalBERT, MentalDistilBERT, and DistilGPT-2 in an ensemble.
Approach Explanation:

Hybrid Search: This combines keyword and vector search to find relevant information from your database. It's effective because it captures both exact matches (keywords) and semantic similarity (vectors).
Multiple Model Generation: The approach generates responses using multiple models, which allows for diverse response styles and knowledge bases.
Safety Checking: Before evaluating responses, they're checked for safety to filter out potentially harmful content.
Comprehensive Evaluation: Responses are scored based on relevance, empathy, and sentiment, which are crucial factors in mental health conversations.
Post-Processing: The final response is augmented with disclaimers and resources, reinforcing the AI's limitations and providing pathways to professional help.

Prompt: "Why is sleep important for mental health?"

Length: Short, inquires about the relationship between sleep and mental well-being.
Medium-Length Prompts
Prompt: "I've been feeling anxious lately, especially in social situations. What can I do to manage my anxiety when I'm around other people?"

Length: Medium, combines a personal experience with a request for advice.
Prompt: "Can you explain the difference between depression and general sadness? How can someone tell if they're depressed or just going through a rough patch?"

Length: Medium, asks for clarification between two similar emotional states.
Prompt: "What are some effective mindfulness exercises I can practice daily to improve my mental health and reduce feelings of anxiety?"

Length: Medium, seeks practical tips for incorporating mindfulness into daily life.
Long Prompts
Prompt: "I have been feeling overwhelmed by my work and personal responsibilities lately, and it seems like no matter how much I try to manage my time, I always end up feeling like I'm falling behind. It's starting to affect my sleep, and I'm becoming more irritable with my family. What are some strategies I can use to better balance my work and personal life while taking care of my mental health?"

Length: Long, describes a complex situation and asks for detailed advice.
Prompt: "Can you provide a detailed explanation of the signs and symptoms of burnout? I've been working long hours, and I'm starting to feel exhausted and detached from my work. I want to understand if what I'm experiencing could be burnout, and if so, what steps I should take to recover and prevent it from happening again."

Length: Long, seeks an in-depth explanation of burnout, symptoms, and recovery strategies.
Prompt: "I've read that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for treating anxiety and depression. Can you explain how CBT works, what the therapy process typically looks like, and whether it's something that could help someone who's been struggling with these issues for a long time? Additionally, are there any self-help techniques based on CBT principles that I can start practicing on my own?"

Length: Long, asks for a comprehensive overview of CBT and practical self-help techniques.
Very Long Prompts
Prompt: "Over the past year, I've noticed a gradual decline in my overall sense of well-being. Initially, I attributed it to the stress of adjusting to remote work and the isolation from friends and colleagues, but as time has gone on, I've started to feel more disconnected from the things that used to bring me joy. My motivation is at an all-time low, and I'm finding it difficult to even start tasks that I know are important. I'm also experiencing more frequent moments of anxiety and self-doubt, particularly around my work performance. Could you provide some guidance on how to start addressing these feelings and regaining a sense of purpose and connection in my life? Additionally, what steps should I consider if I want to seek professional help for these issues?"
Length: Very long, delves into multiple aspects of mental health, including emotional well-being, motivation, and the decision to seek professional help.
Testing Strategy
Short Prompts: Test basic functionality and quick response generation.
Medium-Length Prompts: Test the model's ability to handle slightly more complex inputs with multiple components.
Long Prompts: Assess the model’s capacity to generate detailed, contextually rich responses.
Very Long Prompts: Evaluate the model’s handling of extended input lengths and the preservation of critical information without truncation errors.
