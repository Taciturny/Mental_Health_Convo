form of anxiety there is a phenomenon called the yerkes dodson law see below source wikipedia which basically states that if we feel either too much or too little stress pressure or nervousness about a task it will adversely impact our ability to do carry it out successfully\\\\u00a0the ideal amount of stressarousal is right in the middle  not too little and not too much this applies to more things than we might often realize  from giving a presentation to ordering food to making a free throw to driving to sexual intimacy as in this case a common suggestion that many men find helpful is initiating open and honest conversations with their partners about this issue and for a temporary period of time agreeing to physical intimacy and sexual pleasure in other forms and without the expectation of intercourse there are many ways to go about that which are outside the scope of this blog article but this can be a path to connecting intimately and renewing physical bonding without unhelpful anxiety  and over time can lead back to intimacy in all the ways that have become elusive best of luck\"]}\\n{\"Context\":\"a lot of times i avoid situations where i am to meet new people

terms re your son then the relationship heartache is much easier to recover from than if your sons mother vanished from his life or if the mother wants nothing to do w himre the actual relationship let yourself feel sad and hurt since this is the truthusually life gradually fills in new people including a relationship once you feel strong enough from having endured such sadness and loss\",\"i recognize that you say you are missing being with the love of your life at the same time i dont understand whether you are able to see your son im curious as to the relationship dynamic between you and your sons motherwhen you say that she never looked back i imagine you are conveying that getting back together is not something that she is interested ini would suggest that you talk with a therapist and your local area so that you have the ability to discuss the loss of this person who you love so much most people think of grief related to the loss of someone who has died but it also applies to people who have a significant loss whether that is a relationship a job or any number of other thingsin the meantime try finding something about yourself that you value and can focus

know which way might be advisable if we dont know quite why they would yell or why would they care who you choose to sleep andor partner with to begin withhowever it is of utmost important that you

and all that comes with that and perhaps other issues you might have with it it will be significantly easier for you to tolerate your familys lack of acceptance and perhaps chalk it up to a severe lack of openmindednessbut because it is family and we dont choose our families but are forced to deal with them for the most part for better or worse admittedly im not the biggest fan of outright estrangement processing the loss of the family that i hoped i had will also be important for you moving forward in your life you likely will be able to realize you dont need them to accept your sexual

with many different things there has been a lot of research conducted to prove that counseling is an effective way to help people with mental health concerns life stressors and many other issues in addition there are many people who would tell you that counseling made a positive profound impact on their lives indeed some would tell you that counseling saved their lives now not everyone would tell you that counseling helped but when you think about it there are many medical treatments for a variety of healthcare issues that also do not help everyone so is counseling guaranteed no but it is something that is worth trying if someone is suffering or is just wanting some perspective or support also there is many different types of counseling different counselors have different styles and have different training for various issues this means that you are likely to find someone who has a good style and expertise in an area that you want to work on if you dont know where to go i suggest contacting your states counseling association they can help i think the real question that most people have is how how does it help that question is a bit more complicated because there are many different models of counselingtherapy that work in different ways what i can tell you is that regardless of the model of counseling the relationship between counselor and client is the most important factor i dont mean that the relationship has to be ooowy goowy but it does have to be one where there is trust and openness a counselor will spend time to make sure that you are working together as a

a number of therapists before beginning treatment to find out more about how they practice in order to make sure their style aligns with your goals\\\\u00a0on a more specific note there is myriad

friend because this is a space for your stuff and you get to focus on what you need and dont have to worry about the other side this is also a place where you do not have to worry about how else the other person is involved in the situation beyond this basic level a counselor will have expertise they can bring in terms of how people including you can effectively deal with this kind of situation the counselor may also be aware of connections that you would not otherwise see a good counselor will also recognize if and when you need other help or support in the situation why wouldnt you benefit from having someone walk with you in your journey to peace and wholeness\",\"a counselor can do a few things that can be helpful1 give you a space where you can explore whats in your head without

am going to guess that we may be a bit biased  my answer is this sometimes many people benefit from counseling and when counseling works those benefits can show up through positive improvements in your moods making more choices that align with your values working through stuff and a general improved sense of self sometimes for a variety of reasons a counselor the approach they are using and the person do not match up and when that happens sometimes counseling does not help it is very important to find the right counselor for you ideally this should be someone you feel a level of trust and

everyday circumstances \\\\u00a0when someone feels overwhelmed by their own or someone elses feelings there is no one who asks reflective questionslast people get better in therapy because often

and get your life back on track\\\\u00a0counseling is not like the kind of talking we do to people we know for one your counselor does not have a history with you and has no expectations of how you will act and what you will do in that way counselors come to a session without judgement and expectation this gives you the platform to truly explore your thoughts and feelings a counselor can also help you understand your motivation and help you integrate your past experiences and recommend coping skills that can help you if you are feeling overwhelmed by your emotions\\\\u00a0over time as you work with a counselor you will get feedback and also be able to share new insights the work you do is based on you and where you are at oftentimes when we talk to friends they bring their own agenda to a conversation and while they mean well they may offer solutions that work for them and not you a counselor will help you uncover the solutions that work best for you and help you find the motivation to follow through with your planbest of luck to you\",\"hello yes counseling can be beneficial to many people one of the effective components to effective therapy is when the client becomes willing to participate in the counseling i dont mean just show up and listen to the counselor for 4550 minutes but also that the client themselves opens up and shares with the counselor the issues that brought them to counseling in the first place this requires you to be vulnerable capable of moving past your protective measures of showing the best of yourself and allowing the counselor to see the sides of you that likely are not as favorable therapy works when you and the counselor engage openly honestly and with mutual trust that both of you will work for common goals  your improvement of self it does take time and there are no quick fixes usually so be prepared to invest in yourself and explore the dark places youll thank yourself later knowing that you are more connected to yourself and might even feel more whole after the process be well\",\"i believe that counseling and finding a good therapist\\\\nwill be of significant help when the individual seeking therapy desires

taught to look at what you are experiencing and ask questions about other related ideas that you may not have connected to what you are experiencingthere is a treatment plan in place usually after the first second or third session so both you and the counselor have an idea of where you would like to go with counseling what you are hoping to change or learn and a general idea of a plan for getting to your goalsin general i would say the followingyes counseling can help people who want something to be different in their livescounseling is most helpful when the connection between the counselor and the client is strong enough that some trust forms in other words not every counselor or technique is helpful for every persona lot of counselors will talk to you on the phone for a few minutes prior to you coming in for your first appointment to answer any general questions that you may haveif you are working with a counselor and you feel as though you are not clicking or connecting with one another give it three or four sessions before you change trust is not happening in one hour for most of peopleif you are working with a counselor and you would like to be getting more or something different out of it tell the counselor about that because typically modalities can be changedif you are asking this question because you would like help with a specific issue call a local counselor and discuss it so that you could have a more specific answer about possible options for counseling\",\"yes counseling provides an area for people to speak to an unbiased professional about their concerns to address their unique needs while length of time varies counseling is a process and can be done from as little as one session to multiple sessions counseling provide a safe nonjudgmental empathetic atmosphere from a professional helper provide the service\\\\u00a0\",\"counselling offers a number of ways to help one to improve their situation \\\\u00a0for some this process can take a very long winding path of selfdiscovery while for others they are seeking a purposeful solutionbased way to approach and manage a specific problem its important to remember that there are different styles of therapy some of which will work great with some but poorly with others specifically to help those to decide how they wish to move forward i often recommend speaking with a number of therapists before beginning treatment to find out more about how they practice in order to make sure their style aligns with your goals\\\\u00a0on a more specific note there is myriad research out in the world that indicates both counselling and medication can have an affect on changing our moods and behaviours \\\\u00a0however medication is not an effective way of treating the problem as it treats the symptoms of that problem increased anxiety lowered mood etc and research has shown that the most effective route for better mental health care comes from a combination of counselling and medication\\\\u00a0\",\"there are multiple ways that counseling helps people the most basic is that it gives you someone to talk to about and through what you are facing it is better than a friend because this is a space for your stuff and you get to focus on what you need and dont have to worry about the other side this is also a place where you do not have to worry about how else the other person is involved in the situation beyond this basic level a counselor will have expertise they can bring in terms of how people including you can effectively deal with this kind of situation the counselor may also be aware of connections that you would not otherwise see a good counselor will also recognize if and when you need other help or support in the situation why wouldnt you benefit from having someone walk with you in your journey to peace and wholeness\\\\u00a0\",\"a counselor can do a few things that can be helpful1 give you a space where you can explore whats in your head without worrying about being judged or punished2 help you better understand yourself your choices your motivations3 give you tools and information you can use to help create change in your life\\\\u00a0ultimately though its up to the client to take action because action is what creates change so a counselor cant create change  but they can facilitate and support it\\\\u00a0\",\"hi \\\\u00a0great question \\\\u00a0i believe counseling does help people of course i am a therapist so i would think that  \\\\u00a0seriously  i think therapy and counseling allow us to understand

own sexual history and what you grew up expecting to be normal in the bedroom i can easily imagine that this came as quite a shock to you \\\\u00a0it doesnt necessarily mean however that your husband is gay bisexual transgender or even necessarily a crossdresser etc unless he has already told you so i agree with the other poster who recommended you try and ask him more questions with an open and curious attitude and see if he might be open to explaining more with you\\\\u00a0that being said what we also know from research is that frequently what turns us on isnt always what we identify as \\\\u00a0lots of people have fantasies or even sexual behaviors they may enjoy from time to time without considering themselves to be a part of any label or subculture for example many women are okay with having their hair pulled or bottom spanked during a particular rowdy sexual encounter but certainly dont consider themselves kinky submissive or anything else \\\\u00a0it could be that your husband enjoys pretending fantasizing that he is something completely different in the bedroom from time to time from what most other see him as outside in the corporate world or in other roles he plays as husband father son friend etc \\\\u00a0many of my kink clients are drawn to their particular fetish simply because its the opposite of what their life typically entails eg a high profile ceo who is always responsible for making the decisions enjoys being at the mercy of someone else once a week\\\\u00a0each of us has a sexual script  a blueprint if you will of what we like and dont like in the bedroom and also what we have each come to see as being normal \\\\u00a0its also an internal guideline for how we each define our role in sexual expression sexual orientation sexual behaviors sexual desires and how big a part our sexual identity plays in our everyday lives gagnon  simon 1973youve been clued into the fact that your husbands greatly differs from yours on the surface level at the moment\\\\u00a0all of us are sexual beings yet none of us is exactly identical to one another in our sexual definitions and script expectations its like our own sex fingerprint\\\\u00a0in my role

successfully navigate formulating a plan for both to feel validated and sexually satisfied the relationship thrives\\\\u00a0most counselors would agree that a healthy script includesboth partners taking ownership for the couples sexual experiencesboth partners learning to communicate openly and honestly about their feelingsboth partners learning to meet one anothers  needs desires and wishes while making sure hisher own needs are being metif pegging your husband as its called is a hard and fast no for you that will likely need to be respected as it may be too far off your own sexual script \\\\u00a0however if your husband is for sure absolutely adamant about needing to dress in a female fashion andor be anally penetrated you may seek professional counseling to help navigate how both of you will come to an agreement about fulfilling these desires in a way that doesnt hurt either one of you or the marriagemy warmest wishes to you both\",\"it sounds like you may be asking two different questionswith regard to what you said about your husband dressing as a female in your bedroom i wonder if you would consider asking him more about this if you choose to do that i would suggest that you ask him whether a certain time is a good time to have a conversation and asking questions for five minutes or more that are related to you learning more about his experience this can be difficult to do at times particularly when you may want to offer your own opinions or become very anxious or of type consider thinking of a phrase that may help you to stay calm during the discussion it may be helpful to think of yourself as asking questions as if you were an investigative reporter and using questions that start with words like what how who where when questions that start with why can be very difficult to answer for some people and can be overwhelming because it often links to answers involving emotions that may or may not be understood\\\\u00a0also try restating what your husband is saying to make sure that you are understanding correctly if what he is telling you is different than what you have heard or thought of for many years it may be challenging to follow his meaning initially remember that listening to your husband does not imply agreement with what he is saying just that you are following and looking to understand what he is experiencing i also recommend sticking to one topic for the conversation but this could be done with many different topics over timeyou could also see if he would be willing to have a discussion where he listens like an investigative reporter to learn more about the experience that you are havingas far as what you mentioned about the sexual experience maybe if you can discuss what it is that you dont like andor understand what it is that he does like you could see if there is some middle ground here it depends on what you both preferthese types of conversations can be difficult to have for some couples at least initially having structured conversations such as the ones ive described briefly above can feel awkward initially but the reason it can be helpful is because it can lead to further understanding in a way that decreases the chances of having an argumentalso consider seeing a therapist in your area who specializes in couples to discuss some of these ideas\"]}\\n{\"Context\":\"he

sharing the same core values beliefs expectations and lifestyles without you having a good level of compatibility in your personalities and feeling understood protected cared by supported and loved by each other there is no way you could truly feel and experience a mutually healthy meaningful and fulfilling relationship for the long run\\\\u00a0what has attracted you to each other is good and meaningful enough to empower and support you for the long run many people focus too much on looks financial benefits or other external factors which are important but cannot build a healthy mature and fulfilling lifelong relationship this does not mean many couples do not willingly choose these types of relationship since truly believing those are their top priorities what they ignore is that with time life challenges issues and pain temptations and appealing alternatives around those external factors their relationships would not cope very well but would get gradually or suddenly undermined\\\\u00a0be honest with yourself reflect on what you truly need want and expect from a boyfriend and life partner ask yourself if this person has what it takes to meet those expectations and satisfy those needs and if you are also a very good match for him since there is no way the relationship works unless it does for both of you so while one person could feel blessed by having such a wonderful partner the other could feel frustrated or just not truly fulfilled passionate or happy with herhis partner\\\\u00a0longterm relationships require a lot and when i talk about sharing same core factors i mean truly feeling being a good match to each other at the physical mental emotional and spiritual levels and around all the other roles life\\\\u00a0 involves related to lifestyle as social life habits dreams preferences etcthen there is a lot to reflect on by yourself to carefully evaluate in yourself based on what you already know about you and this person then you would be able to tell yourself if you truly want to continue or not with this person if you feel you do then you have to talk to him and make sure he feels the same way in a scenario where you doubt if you should tell him about this or that as another counselor suggested out of fear of any form of abuse or retaliation those would be serious enough to show you this could never truly work if your fears are more about being misunderstood and judged then you still have to work on developing open and honest communication with him as long as what you expect is something truly healthy and worthy\\\\u00a0many people look for and stay in relationships because they prefer that to be alone by themselves thus they end using relationships to feel better about themselves and their lives to bring some feelings of happiness and company the problem is that if those are the initial core reasons to start or stay in a relationship this can never truly evolve into anything healthy and mutually fulfilling unless the person works on herselfhimself to meet those personal needs and resolve those personal issues which would enable her to work on self and with the other person in the relationship\\\\u00a0finally i want to mention what i shared in a past article on this subject namely you need to assess if your boyfriend has been really consistent in his words and actions otherwise lack of honesty accountability andor respect would never lead to anything worthy in any type of relationships also we are all human beings and that means we are no perfect and we need to work on ourselves to make improvements relationships are a means to keep growing as individuals supporting each other to become better versions of ourselves without manipulation neglect or abuse thus while on one hand healthy love means embracing the whole persona with strengths and weaknesses on the other hand it is fully incompatible with tolerating andor enabling what is distorted or dysfunctional against that person or against ourselves this is why both persons need to be willing and ready to work on making changes and improvements as necessary without this it would be hopeless and helpless to expect things would be just fine with time they would not they would just get worse\\\\u00a0so lets take one step at a time reflect on what you feel need and want now and for the future assess how well this person is able and willing to work on that and dialogue to make sure you are both fully aware understood and clear about your relationship and how well it could make your lives better if professional support is needed and both are willing to take it please do not delay it if one refuses necessary support then face reality and come to terms with what it is showing you trust more actions than words set and keep healthy boundaries and take into account what life experiences show you as well as feedback and counsel from those mature and truly caring people who know you while pushing away what is superficial biased or too rushedthank you for sharing\",\"deciding to end a relationship is a big question that deserves your full care and attention\\\\u00a0 one of the first questions you may ask of yourself and consider for your boyfriend is whether you are both willing to work on the relationship\\\\u00a0 a relationship no matter how great or hard cant work unless both people are invested in working on it\\\\u00a0 this means that both people are willing to take responsibility and work on their on stuff when things are hard rather than blaming the other\\\\u00a0 if one of you is not willing or able to work at this then the relationship cant really grow or get better\\\\u00a0 perhaps spend some time really asking yourself if you this is the person you want to work on things with\\\\u00a0 all relationships are hard and require care and attention and also ask us to really take responsibility for what we contribute\\\\u00a0 this should be done in a relationship where you want to do this work for yourself and the other\\\\u00a0 also if you are fully in and ready to do the work but your partner isnt\\\\u00a0 if they say things like this is just how i am or we have problems because of your issues then you also may want to really slow down and consider if this will be workable\\\\u00a0 you and your boyfriend need to be invested and committed to the relationship even when things are hard\",\"deciding to end a relationship is never easy especially if there is not any strong reason or incident standing out to help define the unhappiness in the relationship such as infidelity or abuse\\\\u00a0 all relationships go through low periods where one or both people may feel unhappy in the relationship this is normal\\\\u00a0 what i tell my clients when they are facing this decision is to spend some time and imagine your life without the person in it\\\\u00a0 what do you feel when you imagine your life without your boyfriend\\\\u00a0 do you see yourself as being happier having more freedom\\\\u00a0 when you think of life without him do you feel a weight lift off your shoulders\\\\u00a0 is it easier to breathe\\\\u00a0 dont rush into any decision about leaving the relationship\\\\u00a0 take as much time as you need to fully understand what it is you are feeling right now\\\\u00a0 ask yourself if some of the unhappiness in the relationship can change if it is likely to change\\\\u00a0 only when you are confident in your decision to leave should you then have the discussion about leaving the relationship\\\\u00a0 i hope this answer gives you some ways of thinking through how to make that very tough decision\",\"hi there thats a big question and really something no one can answer except you here are some things to consider to help you make your decisionwhat is leading you to ask the question has something happened recently or repeatedly that is making you question your relationship if so what is it can you rank it on a scale from 110 1 being not a big deal and 10 being a deal breaker what are your deal breakers and has he violated any of them what are your reasons for being with him how would you feel without him how does he make you feel on a daily basis is there any abuse in the relationship physical emotional psychological  if the answer to this question is yes  please seek immediate help in addition to thinking about your relationship on your own have you talked with your boyfriend about how youre feeling if it is safe to do so honest open communication might help you get some more clarity you dont have to say im thinking about breaking up with you but you can say something along the lines of im having some doubts about our relationship can we talk about us if you want to stay with him maybe you can work on your relationship together going to couples counseling could also be an option for youif you decide that the relationship is not working think about how you would like to be broken up with and if possible try to come from a place of kindness and understanding\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0as always im happy to provide more guidance if youd like good luck with you decision\",\"that you are questioning if you should end your relationship with your boyfriend tells me that you are unhappy with him spend sometime by yourself exploring the reasons for that unhappiness are these things likely to change or not\",\"without knowing the details it would be very difficult to say but thats also the point of my response because even with the details its very hard to say as no one is experiencing the relationship in your shoes except for you it might be helpful to process this in therapy or with your boyfriend directly and voice your concerns about the relationship in any successful relationship the research has shown that openness in communication is vitalthat all being said i would also add with a lot of curiosityif you have to ask the question does that say something about what you feel is the quality of the relationship\",\"if youre asking the question then probably you are pretty close to ending your relationshipmake a list of what you dont like and then decide whether youd like to tell these topics to your boyfriend as a discussion about your relationshiphe may have similar feelings and together the two of you may figure out new ways to be loving with each otherif youve presented your needs and no change results then ask yourself if you can be happy with him given what you now realize about him and your feelings\"]}\\n{\"Context\":\"how do i ever trust another woman

independent\",\"Response\":[\"hello so someone made you happy but is no longer around i am sure that feels devastating as a counselor i usually have to ponder this kind of thought because it lends itself to suggesting that happiness comes from the external rather than the internal side of a persons life happiness is formed within ourselves all the external trappings of happiness are usually quite fleeting and temporary even relationships fo not last forever if we get to a place where we are reliant and dependent on those around us to create happiness in our lives then we lose the opportunities for us to do it ourselves we are entirely capable of finding ways to be happy sometimes this entails working out issues that are holding us back from reaching a place of peace or resolution to a specific problemwhat i would offer to you is to find ways in which you can develop happiness for yourself what do you like about your life as it is right now what can you do to create change in your life to increase your happiness these kinds of questions can be valuable to you as you seek out ways to make happiness an internal rather than an external event mourning the loss of a social connection in whatever way that occurred is part of the grieving process but it is not permanent it is a path to healing and moving forward from this you can seek out new sources of happiness i encourage you to remember that happiness is independent of the external experience you have in the world happiness is an expression of the internal feelings so that will be the source or the font of positive emotion from which you really draw if you are lacking in happiness then it becomes important to examine why that is and what you can do about it to promote selfcare seeking out a professional counselor can also be a good option as you move through the griefloss process and examine the reasons happiness is not in greater supplyi wish you happiness for every day of your lifebest wishes\",\"it sounds like you have been feeling pretty down since the loss of a relationship and youre wondering how to be happy by yourself intimacy is a very natural human desire and at the same

language throughout their site pick someone who is more in line with your personality and wants for your futureand even if you do your research beforehand and figure out you arent vibing after a few

httpswwwtherapybyshannoncomblog220191147thingscounselingshouldandshouldntbe\",\"i think its crucial that a person finds the right therapist questions questions questions first i would ask them if they have experience and training in whatever the primary issues are that you are wanting to work on you want to make sure the therapist has the skills and experience to help you its okay to ask have you worked with these issues before and can you tell me what methods you use to treat these issues and are the methods you use evidencedbased then i would ask what expectations the therapist is going to have of you the client do they expect you to do homework come with something to talk about each session or keep a journal see if their expectations align with what you are looking for and lastly i would schedule a session and try out the therapist\\\\u00a0 see if you feel comfortable and safe\\\\u00a0 as for training your therapist i would suggest you be the leader of your therapy ask for what you want be direct and do hesitate to tell your therapist if you feel you are not getting what you need they cant read your mind and would likely find that information very valuable they want you to feel better and to make progress and if they are going down the wrong path you should let them know\",\"the first thing i would ask yourself is how do you feel when it is time to go to therapy what do you notice inside your body are you sick to your stomach neutral dreading it your body will give you indications as to how safe you feel your relationship with your therapist is like any other relationshipyou need to feel safe accepted and understood you want to see someone who you look forward to sitting across from and feel comfortable talking about whatever is on your heart and mind\\\\u00a0 what are you preferences do you feel more comfortable with a male or female therapist does their age matter what kind of therapy do you want to do do you know if not you might want to talk to friends or family who have done therapy and ask them what they liked or didnt like what worked for them and what the process was like you can always talk to a prospective therapist about all the questions you have have they worked with others with your issues have they ever been in therapy where did they go to school what kind of training do they have etc you may not know in the first session or two if you have the right therapist but pay attention to how you feel while you are there your therapist should check in with you and ask how you are feeling if its not a good match for you your therapist should try and help you find someone who will be a good match your trust and connection with your therapist is the biggest indicator for success in therapy both of you should be concerned about your alliance and any good therapist will want you to find the best therapist for you\",\"you can certainly ask the therapist questions such as their style or issues they have experience working with you can also determine whether a therapist is the right fit if you feel a connection or alliance and feel that you are working together toward your goals it is important to be open and honest with your therapist about what you are looking for in counseling\",\"though this varies from person to person i think finding the right therapist involves finding someone who youre comfortable opening up to and speaking your mind including your preferred areas of focus for treatment its important to be aligned with your therapists general approach and to find someone who you feel genuinely attuned to both in practice and also with who they are as a person bringing up your needs for treatment is key and finding someone who validates your needs listens and welcomes feedback are all important building blocks for creating space for a great working relationship that promotes personal growth openness and invites adaptable approaches in session based on your individual needs\",\"how do you know anything is right for you i think its an intuitive process and not always based on the objective expertise of the therapist either most psychotherapy research has concluded that the clienttherapist relationship is the strongest factor in success in therapy but in my view what is important to checkin with yourself around whether or not the therapist can hold space for all that you come in with for example not expressing discomfort with things you might talk about is a big run away challenge you enough where you feel like it is challenging you to grow but also where there is some part of you that does look forward to the sessionshow to train your therapist this could be a session in and of itself i must say the therapistclient relationship can resemble many of the relationships in your life or those that you seek out a therapist like anyone else in your life wont be able to give you what you need 100 of the time and then expect that you will be able to function outside of the space that can turn into a highly enabling process that wont help your other relationships however what the therapist can do and help you deal with is to tell you what they can and cant give you and then process the disappointment that you feel when they cant be everything you might feel you need\",\"hello and thanks for your question its important to have the right therapist i encourage you to start by checking out the website of the therapist their blog articles will reflect the kind of work they do and the approach they may take while working with you if theres an email listed go ahead and reach out ask the particular questions that are on your mind share a little of what you are looking for in a therapist are you a goaldirect solutionfocused individual who is looking for someone to listen and ask questions are you less selfdirective and desire a therapist who can give you the consistent push to move forward are you interested in intertwining certain theory approaches maybe a cognitivebase or experiential art therapy or engaging in exercise while talking your therapist is out there its ok to try out a therapist for a session or two interview them as they interview you its also ok to change therapists ask your present therapist for a referral he or she should be willing to provide you with names of other providers and theres no shame in asking for it you deserve to work with someone who fits your stylei imagine theres already enough things happening in your life if you are searching for a therapist do you really want to train your therapist after all you are paying them for their knowledge and expertise it does take time to develop a relationship and developing one with your therapist is vital to your growth and satisfaction participating in therapy for the most part should be a time you anticipate and not avoid can you be honest with them are you trusting of the confidentiality they provide has this person clearly shared with you the limits of confidentiality if using insurance versus paying privately is there any part of you that just isnt sure its okay to assert yourself in therapy as a therapist i invite you to assert yourself as its a way to develop selfconfidence and resiliency not everyone thrives in therapy by sitting in an office or lounging on a couch some folks benefit by challenging themselves in various environments or are more comfortable in their homes online in the community at a retreat etc give yourself a gift of spending some time finding the person that can work with you towards what you are searching although theres the convenience of the local nonprofit agency in your area it may not be what you need also limiting yourself to the names of providers listed on your insurance may not lead to the right one there are many forms of therapy that insurances refuse to cover when this happens many times you can be reimbursed for your expenses by your insurance or you can use a health savings card or flexible spending card there are many many options therapy is about exploring yourself go ahead and feel freeif you feel as if you need to train your

life as long as a therapist is ethical and not breaking any ethical practices find someone you connect with and can share with\",\"finding the right therapist for you may take time  or you may find one the first try two important things to think about when first finding a therapist are do i feel safe and do i feel heard the first time seeing a therapist can be anxiety provoking it may be uncomfortable unless there are giant red flags about a therapist things beyond meeting someone for the first time and answering uncomfortable but important questions i always suggest seeing a therapist 34 times before making a decision to try another it may end up that you feel like your therapist isnt the best fit for you but again i encourage you to give them a couple times before moving on when you get past the initial sessions of paperwork and gathering information you can gauge the client  therapist relationship better and when you find the right person to work with you will know

would suggest not looking to train the therapist but rather to find one that will help you develop into the you that you desire to be finding the right therapist is like finding a pair of black heels not just any black heels will do but when you find them you just know that your search is over it is also wise to expect that they wont always feel comfortable\",\"youll know you have the right therapist when after the first few sessions you feel comfortable enough to tell them things you wouldnt tell anyone else its important in therapy for that rapport to be built from the beginning and that you as the client feel comfortable enough to share what you need to share you shouldnt feel judgement from your therapist and you should be able to trust the advice your therapist provides therapy isnt about advice dont get me wrong but to truly implement the changes that need to be implemented to improve your life you need to trust the person giving the advice your therapist should have your best interest at heart and truly listen to what you have to say the therapist should be willing to meet you where you are in your world and attempt to see the world from your perspective to truly understand what you have been through you need to feel comfortable in therapy to be yourself and say whats on your mind therapy shouldnt be something that should be dreaded but it can get uncomfortable depending on the depth of the things being discussed\",\"finding the right therapist can be difficult especially if youve never tried it before things to consider are location availability and what specifically are you looking for some practitioners specifically only work with a certain type of issue ie eating disorders adolescents anger management life transitions anxietyetc and others can work with a variety of concerns\\\\u00a0as far as training your therapist you cant you simply let them know what you are looking to work on or what you think may be an issue for you depending on the way they practicetheir style of working with clients is how they will then decide to make a treatment plan that works best for you\\\\u00a0you can always ask them their specialty practice population the problems they generally help others with and what type of mental health provider they are psychologist social worker licensed mental health counselor\",\"choosing the right therapist can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming i know many people come to therapy with hesitations and potential fears but a therapist should be there to help you along the way and support you as you build a trusting and collaborative relationship you wont have to train your therapist to give you what you need through open dialogue and feedback you and your therapist together can determine what works best for you but do remember that being able to trust your therapist to guide and support you is key so if youre having a hard time connecting with your therapist after 34 sessions you will want to bring it up to them so you can discuss any barriers and if needed request a referral for another therapist\",\"counselors do not expect to gain your trust during the first session trust is earned and gained through the therapeutic process you may know you have the right therapist if you feel a lack of judgement or even unconditional positive regard for the choices you make in therapy good counselors will keep you accountable for your actions without making you feel ashamed of the choice you madecounselors already have the training to give you what you need in treatment and if they dont they are ethically obligated to refer you to a provider that does that being said the first few visits with your counselor will be goal oriented creating realistic and obtainable goals that will allow you and your therapist to see positive change when it is made\",\"you will know you have the right therapist when you feel at ease and comfortable to share deep feelingsyou do not hold back and feel total acceptance and validation by your therapist listen to your feelings and letthem guide your decisionyour therapist and you will work together to decide what is best for you with regards to

has to feel right\\\\u00a0 while that sounds vague and not very scientific it is the most important part of therapy\\\\u00a0 us counselors call it therapeutic rapport and without it therapy is not very effective\\\\u00a0 you want to know you can trust your therapist that you are not being judged that they respect your privacy that you feel comfortable talking to them about the good and the bad\\\\u00a0 you want to feel heard and know you therapist is genuine  not all therapist are a good fit for everyone\\\\u00a0 go with your gut  as an added note i recommend going with a therapist who has done their own therapy\",\"what an important question i think one of the first things to assess is this do you feel comfortable with your therapist do you feel like you can talk openly about whats going on in your life without feeling judged do you experience your therapy as a safe space to process your thoughts and feelings feeling comfortable with your therapist is a crucial factor\\\\u00a0once you feel comfortable with your therapist you can have a conversation about what works for you in therapy tell your therapist what is helpful and what you dont find helpful a skilled therapist can shift his or her style and techniques to meet your individual needs and this may be an ongoing conversation that the two of you have during therapy\\\\u00a0oftentimes there is just an x factor between client and therapist that either makes the relationship work or can make it feel like something is missing this is no ones fault its just that not every therapist will be a perfect match for every client\\\\u00a0if you feel uncomfortable with your therapist or feel like that x factor is missing it is a good idea to keep searching for therapist who is right for you\",\"this is a great question finding the right therapist can be tricky because you dont really know how someone will be like until you meet them a few ways to prescreen are to visit the therapists website psychologytoday profile social media etc have a phone call with the therapist prior to your first appointmentonce you meet your therapist it is important to be clear with your wishes and expectations we are trained in helping you thrive in your life but we cannot mind read so if you dont tell us we wont know dont be shy about what you like and what you dont like a good therapist will listen to your needs process them with you and create a customized plan that works for you and your life a good therapist will also not take anything you say even criticism personally\\\\u00a0coming to therapy is hard and often times you might not want to go what makes a good therapist is someone who understands this and tries to make you feel as comfortable as possible while you address uncomfortable topics\",\"i believe that the right counsellor will help you feel empowered supported and understood you should feel comfortable opening up and not be concerned that they will judge you for what you say or decide to do i find this important to let my clients know during intake that they will never be judged for the decisions they decide to take while going over options in sessions together with me\\\\u00a0in terms of what you need from treatment please feel comfortable to open up to your therapist and tell them what you need from them for example do you prefer them to challenge you with questions listen to your story and ask questions throughout or near the end give you work to do outside of sessions the therapy sessions will work best for you if you can help them support you in what will work for youit can sometimes take a few trials of different therapists to find the right one so please do not give up if you feel disheartened you should feel proud of yourself for taking the first big step in asking for help that is not easy to do and you are on the right track already\",\"such a good question \\\\u00a0sometimes clients will feel like they are not connecting with their therapist and will put it on themselves \\\\u00a0in truth the bond between therapist and client is the 1 predictor of positive outcomes in therapy \\\\u00a0ask yourself these questions does it feel like this person can come to care about me \\\\u00a0do they remember from week to week what we touched on \\\\u00a0do i feel compassion from this person do they allow me my difficult and

are quite good at determining whether or not someone fits well with their personality and style and another key to know whether therapy is working is to ask yourself\\\\u00a0 do i see that changes have come about since working with this therapist\\\\u00a0 do i feel better am i reaching goals that i set at the onset of therapy\\\\u00a0 are difficult situations becoming easier by how i handle

to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client\",\"Response\":[\"there are typically three reasons why therapy is terminated1 client has met therapy goals2 client is not progressing\\\\u00a03 therapist is not a good fit for clientin order to properly assess whether therapy is helping and what progress is being made the therapist needs to have ways of consistently checking in with clients sessionsbysession to determine what is helping what isnt and where the client is at in relation to their original therapy goals when a client has met their goals that is a good time to end counselling sessions unless the client has new goals or simply wants to checkin periodically to make sure that they are still on track sometimes referred to as relapse prevention\\\\u00a0when a client is not progressing and feedback has been taken and attempts have been made to make the therapy more helpful for the client but to no avail than it is considered unethical to continue to work with the client in these circumstances referring out to another therapist who may be a better fit is a good idea\",\"hello the end of the counselorclient relationship is one of mutual respect and engagement counseling sessions can end for any number of reasons among them are the clients inability to make forward progress in therapy the clinicians inability to help the client for a variety of reasons a mutually agreed upon time frame for a number of sessions to be provided or the financial challenges of the client who decides that they need to put their resources elsewhere in this last case a counselor should never cancel sessions with a client simply on the basis of the clients inability to pay that is traditionally seen as an unethical practice other arrangements can be made to provide care to the client which in itself should be paramountwhen the client and therapist decide that services are done it is best if there is at least one or two more sessions to allow a case file review to occur and to bring an appropriate psychological sense of closure to the client and vicariously to the clinician as well those this is perhaps not as important this transition gives both a sense of having reached the end of a journeyrather than some abrupt departure from it an abrupt ending in therapy can have a varying level of impact both emotionally and psychologically on the client and therapist sometimes the closure of therapy is the result of a program of therapy being formally completed in which there is a mutually known albeit perhaps approximate date of when that program will be finished in this case the client is likely feeling that impending closure and has time to prepare mentally and emotionally from a place of being the client in therapy to a place of healing growth and situational resolutioni have always worked in therapy with the following slogan if you will that i learned years ago during graduate school not every therapist is good for every client and not every client is good for every therapist it is perhaps one of the most important guiding views i hold in working with clients the therapeutic relationship is driven by mutuality  the desire of the client to get better at living life and the therapists desire to truly see the client heal and grow when there is a block in this process from either side that prevents that synergy from occurring the relationship that should be established may not be able to form or if already formed may at some point be unable to move forward in these instances referring the client to another type of service or clinician is appropriate usually this can be seen pretty quickly by either party though sometimes it is not always clearultimately the client and counselor need to work together to discover if the needs of the client which is paramount are being met in the therapeutic engagement with their current counselor or if other arrangements need to be made to go elsewhere if both are observant in this process they can work together to maintain that sacred space and continue to reach the goals that have been set eventually therapy will end but hopefully based on the clients successful journey to the place where they wanted to go and thus opening the next chapters of their life to a space that is more whole and brighter\",\"hopefully both the client and counselor would together decide when to terminate counseling sessions its really helpful for the client to leave counseling with a solid sense of what he or she has accomplished in counseling so it can be a good idea to spend some time acknowledging that in the last session or sessions sometimes however a client has needs beyond the scope of the counselors expertise thats a good time for a conversation about those needs and ideas of \\\\u00a0how best to meet them whether by adding in care with an additional mental health professional or transferring care entirely to a new mental health provider\",\"there are different reasons why a counselor may seek to terminate with a client and these will each have different processes by which the counselor will come to that decision here are a few examples\\\\u00a0the counselor may determine that the clients needs are outside what the counselor is competent to be able to work with a person may have come to the counselor talking about a particular issue but either when they first met or as counseling progressed it may become clear that the issue is in fact something different or that there is an additional related issue if that issue is outside the competence of the counselor the counselor should look for alternatives the most common of which would be to terminate and refer beyond clinical issues this could also come up around particular other related facts such as the culture of the client or linguistic issues this could also be the choice of the counselor if they know someone that they feel would be a better match for the clients issues\\\\u00a0another reason for discharge and possible referral would be if the relationship does not seem to be a good fit no counselor is the right person to work with everyone if the right level of connection is not happening the counselor will often look first at what they are doing might talk about it with the client and ultimately will admit that things dont seem to be working to allow the desired therapeutic process to work a similar process would be followed if the counselor determined that the client might not yet be ready for counseling as evidenced by lack of engagement such as frequent cancellations not doing any agreed on work between sessions showing up late or being really guarded in session\\\\u00a0the easiest situation to decide on is when a person has met their counseling goals and have nothing new that they are working on while this is the easiest one to determine it is also probably the hardest one for the counselor as they may be like the client in not wanting the relationship to come to an end however counselors know that this is part of the process they will also determine this by regularly reviewing the treatment plan or by sending in the sessions that the work has come to an end this type of termination maybe final or may be with the intent that the client will return later to address other things that have been identified but for which they are not ready to move into\\\\u00a0all of these and other situations involves the counselor being open to the relationship ending to monitoring how things are going then engaging in self reflection possibly talking with the client and then coming to a conclusion on which the counselor \\\\u00a0follows through\",\"from the very beginning of counseling sessions i emphasize that the work will and must end at some pointin counseling there is an arc to the process a beginning middle and end\\\\u00a0i am always digging searching and exploring\\\\u00a0there comes a point where things

usually during the initial evaluation i identify my clients short term and long term therapy goals\\\\u00a0 as therapy progress we verify goals on a monthly to a quarterly basis depending on the frequency of the appointments\\\\u00a0 once the therapy goals have been met there is a closing session the counseling relationship is ended and the client can stop attending sessions\\\\u00a0 in some cases the client can also establish new goals and determine if i am a good fit for their therapy needs or if they need a new provider in which case i provide multiple referralsthe counseling relationship could also end due to other factors like noncompliance when a client is not committed to the agreed treatment process or when the clients or a counselor violates the counseling relationship \\\\u00a0either the counselor or the client is able to end counseling\\\\u00a0 although as mental health providers we need to provide a reason for terminating our therapeutic relationship

been made that the client can continue without that support there are exceptions to this rule but for the most part this is when counselors begin termination for some clients this is an easy process that marks the achievements they have made in working through their emotions and difficulties for some other clients however this is a difficult process in which they are losing a valuable support and are understandably anxious about what life will be like without the frequent meetings ultimately termination is different for everyone and there are many ways that termination can be healthy and helpful\",\"as a therapist who believes in client selfdetermination above most other elements of the process i want to as much as possible leave it up to the client to determine when they are finished in the case of a termination because a clients distress has resolved i might periodically check in with the client about how therapy has been going and if we want to reevaluate where we arethe more unfortunate situation would come about if i felt that i wasnt the best fit for the client i would offer that in words and ideas of therapists with names of who i thought might be a better fit and why it still is up to the client whether to continue however should they want to keep seeing me a part of the work would be about that want to see someone who professionally doesnt believe they can help as much as someone elsei also find it perplexing when i hear a client or on a personal level tell me that their therapist said they didnt need therapy i dont know that i buy into that scenario all that much because i do believe that yes not everyone needs therapy but that everyone can benefit from therapy and i dont believe it is the therapists job to deter someone from ever seeking out help of any kind\",\"ideally termination should be a mutual process its not that the therapist kicks the client out at some point and says okay youre done rather over time the client will decrease the frequency with which heshe comes to session so that it may start off as weekly then decrease to biweekly then perhaps once every three weeks then oncemonth and so on throughout this process the therapist and client should have had regular check ins about progress toward goals if the client feels good about where heshe is in life heshe might decide to suspend therapy for now that being said the therapist should make it very clear that if the client ever decided to return for maintenance therapy or a check in heshe would always be welcome\\\\u00a0there is no hard and fast rule to ending or a particular time period in which it must end what matters most is that the client feels good about it and knows that the therapist will always be there should heshe wish to return\",\"for a therapist deciding to end counseling sessions or terminate working with a client is a thoughtful and intentional decision one that is not entered into lightly\\\\u00a0while there are many considerations counselors take into account to help answer this question ill offer an example of two areas that counselors take into consideration when ending counseling sessionsdoes the client need different or more specialized care than the current counselor can provide this requires the counselor to determine whether referring the client to another therapist or health care provider is neededand has the therapeutic relationship reached treatment goals\\\\u00a0while this question is specific to the counselor id like to also add that a client at any time can end counseling\",\"in general i usually let the client decide when this should occur sometimes with some clients it will be a joint agreement but even in that case it should weigh mostly on what the client feels in short

counseling is if the counselor feels that he or she does not have the skills or experience to work with the client \\\\u00a0this may happen during the intake process or after working with the client for some time \\\\u00a0if the clinician feels that the client is not benefitting from the therapy it is ethical to suggest that the client terminate the therapy \\\\u00a0the process of termination must not injure the client and if necessary the clinician may need to refer the client to other treatment modalities \\\\u00a0another reason to terminate working with a client is if the client needs a higher level of care \\\\u00a0if the client has a crisis or is at risk of hurting himself or someone else he or she may need a higher level of care \\\\u00a0in this circumstance the clinician may need to involve outside services such as a crisis unit \\\\u00a0a third reason to terminate with a client is if the clinician feels that he or she cannot remain professional with the client relationship \\\\u00a0for example if the issues that the client is working on bring up something significant for the clinician and the clinician feels that he is unable to separate that from the professional relationship \\\\u00a0in this instance the clinician should refer the client to another therapist \\\\u00a0finally if the client has reached her goals for therapy and no longer needs treatment the clinician and client should terminate treatment\",\"counseling ends when the client has received the maximum benefit from the therapist even if the therapist believes the client is not making progress

healthy relationship and they get to feel a sense of\\\\ncontrol on creating that ending\\\\u00a0good luck to you\",\"in the best case scenario its a mutual discussion and decision if not \\\\u00a0ive had the discussion initiated both ways by me when i sense the client has gone has far as they want by lack of interest in accepting or completing homework assignments missing or cancelling appointments usually at the last minute lack of participation during sessions \\\\u00a0client initiates by asking me pointed questions about why the need for homework assignments by forgetting their calendar or their checkbook   by suggesting that we make appointments over longer intervals once a week to once a month for example \\\\u00a0i rarely have had to terminate a working relationshipthats why i dont charge for the first visit so we know if we are a good fit before we start working together \\\\u00a0then i periodically ask whether the client feels we are making progress moving in the right direction talking about the most relevant issues etc\",\"in my therapy practice the decision to end therapy is mutually made together with the patientotherwise the person can end up with a sense of tremendous rejection and abandonmentthe way youll both know therapy is coming to a close is that the discussion will feel lighter and move easilythe persons mood will be better they will smile more sit in their seat in a more relaxed way look more at ease take better care of their appearanceone of the ways to end therapy is to gradually decrease the frequency of the sessionssometimes people who are in my practice start to come each three weeks then monthly then every three monthsthis gives a sense of security friendliness and casualness to the therapy and demedicalizes it as though the person was treated for a medical symptom and the symptom stops completely one daytalk therapy is about life and life problems usually end graduallyi end my therapy in a way which mirrors the life process in which many interaction and situation problems show their effects gradually and show different effects over time\",\"hi there\\\\u00a0there are a number of reasons why a therapeutic relationship might end including but not limited to the client reaching their goals the client reaching a place of acceptance where they wish to remain or even a breach within the relationship \\\\u00a0the last aspect should likely be taken to supervision in order to be fully processed \\\\u00a0all of these things could happen and usually happen organically again except for the last example\\\\u00a0your question however was about the counselor ending treatment this is a bit more difficult and can be very nervewracking \\\\u00a0it may be beneficial to take this with you to supervision as well \\\\u00a0its important to understand why you feel the need to end or terminate with the client as well do you feel that they would be better suited for another therapist have they achieved their goals or is it something elsein regular openended sessions i try to make a point of checking in with the clients fairly frequently in these checkins i use the time to ask the client how they feel about the sessions and if there is anything they wish to focus on more astutely \\\\u00a0i also ask if they have any immediate goals that they would like to prioritize \\\\u00a0in goaloriented sessions i check in more frequently to ensure that both the client and i remain focused and should they wish to shift their focus that they recognize it is part of my responsibilities to make sure we move back to the desired goal\\\\u00a0often especially in longer term therapeutic relationships we as clinicians can see that the client has reached their goal however they are apprehensive about ending therapy \\\\u00a0this is actually a great place to go with them why would they feel unable to handle issues in their external or internal environment without you often having this open discussion can increase empowerment and mastery that said it could also highlight other issues which the client may have been apprehensive about going into within therapy and now as the relationship seems to be ending feels more confident in bringing these up\\\\u00a0in the case where the relationship is a toxic one terminating with a client may be the best option for both of you its a difficult conversation but recall that part of the role of the therapist is to model that these discomforts can be managed\\\\u00a0i hope that this brief response can assist you going forward\",\"this is a question that is very specific to each person there are definitely some variables but i can give you some general ideas for when counseling might endwhen a client has met all of their goals at least to a degree when they feel that they no longer need to work on them with the assistance of a counselorsometimes a decision is made that a client is no longer benefiting from counseling at a certain timesometimes clients have to remain in counseling in order to receive medication this depends on agency policy but sometimes it is a requirement if the medication is necessary and cannot be prescribed by a primary care physician frequency of sessions is usually decreased greatlyim not sure why you are asking this question but it is also something that is often discussed at the beginning of treatment oftentimes discharge goals change as treatment progresses because more is known about clients their goals changes in their goals and many other things changes are normal but your counselor probably has discharge goals in mind at least generally from the beginning i strongly encourage you to ask about it\",\"there are different reasons why a counselor may seek to terminate with a client and these will each have different processes by which the counselor will come to that decision here are a few examples\\\\u00a0the counselor may determine that the clients needs are outside what the counselor is competent to be able to work with a person may have come to the counselor talking about a particular issue but either when they first met or as counseling progressed it may become clear that the issue is in fact something different or that there is an additional related issue if that issue is outside the competence of the counselor the counselor should look for alternatives the most common of which would be to terminate and refer beyond clinical issues this could also come up around particular other related facts such as the culture of the client or linguistic issues this could also be the choice of the counselor if they know someone that they feel would be a better match for the clients issues\\\\u00a0another reason for discharge and possible referral would be if the relationship does not seem to be a good fit no counselor is the right person to work with everyone if the right level of connection is not happening the counselor will often look first at what they are doing might talk about it with the client and ultimately will admit that things dont seem to be working to allow the desired therapeutic process to work a similar process would be followed if the counselor determined that the client might not yet be ready for counseling as evidenced by lack of engagement such as frequent cancellations not doing any agreed on work between sessions showing up late or being really guarded in session\\\\u00a0the easiest situation to decide on is when a person has met their counseling goals and have nothing new that they are working on while this is the easiest one to determine it is also probably the hardest one for the counselor as they may be like the client in not wanting the relationship to come to an end however counselors know that this is part of the process they will also determine this by regularly reviewing the treatment plan or by sending in the sessions that the work has come to an end this type of termination maybe final or may be with the intent that the client will return later to address other things that have been identified but for which they are not ready to move into\\\\u00a0all of these and other situations involves the counselor being open to the relationship ending to monitoring how things are going then engaging in self reflection possibly talking with the client and then coming to a conclusion on which the counselor \\\\u00a0follows through\\\\u00a0\",\"goodbyes can be hard\\\\r\\\\nchances are most of the goodbyes you have experienced in your life have been\\\\r\\\\ndifficult saying goodbye to a therapist can be different it can be an\\\\r\\\\nopportunity to create a healthy ending in a positive relationship in your life\\\\r\\\\nif you work with a

start with picking up the phone \\\\u00a0its most definitely an uncomfortable feeling but once that first step is taken it is often met with a wave of relief\\\\u00a0my recommendation is always to call and speak with a therapist over the phone before scheduling an appointment listening to how they converse use their tone and inflection may give you a brief insight to how they will respond to you and increase your comfort right away you may also discover rather quickly that this therapist is not the right match for youregardless of how you go about it i like to remind all people who call email text or walkin therapists are a bit like pizzas  if you dont like the toppings send it back there are hundreds of therapists offering all kinds of styles of therapy  take the time to pick one that suits you\",\"most counselors are very approachable and many offer a 15 minute chat by phone to allow you to talk about your issue and to get a feel for the counselor \\\\u00a0if you like what you hear by phone the next step is to set up a facetoface meeting studies show that the most important element in effective therapy is that you feel a connection with your counselor \\\\u00a0trust your instincts and if you dont feel comfortable let him or her know that you dont think its a good fit \\\\u00a0many counselors list on websites like psychology today and good therapy \\\\u00a0visit these websites to learn more about therapists in your area\",\"hi great question my suggestion would be to google therapists in your area \\\\u00a0one great website is called psychology today which is a national site \\\\u00a0you can search for therapists in your zip code and search more specifically for the issue you are seeking support about \\\\u00a0its a great way to find out if they therapist

before the client ever actually calls the local therapist there is often a tipping point in the internal struggle that the client experiences where they can no longer deal with the issues on their own and thus giving the motivation to seek external help that said clients usually go seeking therapists based on what their insurance will cover or what is likely to be more and more the case in the near futurewhat they are able to pay for out of pocket that first phone call to a prospective counselor can often feel like torture but it doesnt have to stay that way counselors are well trained to acknowledge the inherent goodness of all clients and should be able to see and hear the sense of fear in the client of being judged or put down in some way the counselor you select should be compassionate caring able to join with you on your journey to resolving your issues or concerns and to do so without negative judgment of you as a person of worthonce you have found a counselor you want to work with you would then schedule an appointment to meet that first session is often very low key there might be some forms for you to complete which will help the counselor address your concerns and learn a bit more about you the counselor will typically provide you with what we generally call in the profession a professional disclosure or practice statement this document which may be several pages long usually outlines the counselors credentials practice rules forms of payment office hours emergency contact details and confidentiality guidelines under state and federal law among other details all of this benefits you as the client so that you are well informed and can focus your attention on why you are meeting with the counselorin the first session it is absolutely okay to be nervous heres a really big secret which is important to keep in mind as counseling begins counselors are often as nervous if not more to meet a new client as the client is to meet their new counselor its true we as professionals are trying to put our best foot forward to impress you with our awesome counseling skills while simultaneously hiding all the troubling unwanted issues that we ourselves have in our life too and being worried that we might not know if we can help the client sitting in front of us what makes it even more challenging is that counselors are often put on a giant pedestal of perfection by clients all while we as counselors tend to look at it like were standing on a three legged stool this is normal for us when seen from the eyes of the client counselors and clients are both human and we both make mistakes coming from that place of understanding might bring a sense of ease to both the client and the therapist as they seek to work together\\\\u00a0part of this perception of perfection held by clients toward counselors is that the skills of the counselor might look like they have all the answers we honestly do not plain and simple counselors come from life experiences where they might be farther down on lifes road than you they hold completion of various forms of training and have advanced education yet we are in the end imperfect beings struggling to help imperfect people this makes it easier to be compassionate to new clients walking through our door with the hope that we will receive that same compassion in return very often we can find ourselves reflected in our clients lives with their struggles and can become more effective at helping if we have resolved similar issues in our own life so as you begin to seek out a therapist try looking for one who is aware of their own life issues and is actively working on them too someone who can meet you where you are at emotionally and can understand your sense of your struggle that you are facing at the present moment that counselor may be a good example for you as you enter into therapy and build your own strength and thus begin dealing with the issues more effectively you bring up in therapy\",\"usually people call me by phone they introduce themselves we chat for a bit then we schedule a time for their appointment\",\"honestly dont talk with your close friends first yknow the ones you actually can tell sht to not the more surface level ones godblesstheirsoulsbe with your family should you have a fine relationship with them tell them and utilize them they gave you life and

get you closer to god  and aint that a big thinggo with those around you first that actually might give a crp about you first before going to a total stranger youve never met before that is just as

little research online a quick search for the type of counseling you are looking for can be helpful there are lots of counselors out there to choose from so many times you will have to take it a few steps further than that check out their website social media and any reviews but remember people are not always very nice if you plan on using insurance to pay for at least part of the services look for one that is in your network you can find out if someone is in your network by looking for providers on your insurances website if your coverage isnt that great and you know youre going to be paying for it all anyway because youre an allstar and verified your coverage already with the insurance company then you can really pick any counselor you want but working with one that is at least out of network will give you the benefit of having it applied to your deductible if you have any questions about that process or just want some help in getting your benefits from the insurance company

expertise \\\\u00a0if you feel like you connect you can schedule a first session where you will tell them more about yourself and why you are seeking therapy \\\\u00a0the thing to remember is that therapists want you to reach out to them and they are happy to be approached for support \\\\u00a0good luck \\\\u00a0\",\"starting the counseling process can be daunting but here are some ways that hopefully help make the process a little less overwhelming\\\\u00a0firstid start with finding a therapist through a therapist directory and searching for a therapist specifically in your area and with the expertise youre looking for there are many reputable therapist directories online that offer specific information and links to therapist websites to learn more about how they can helpnext\\\\u00a0id pick two or three of interest to contact directly have a list of questions that are important to you that you can ask to determine whether a particular therapist is a good fit many

helps2 ask some friends to listen to your presentations\\\\u00a0not so much for their input as to just get used to presenting3 focus on the material you are presenting\\\\u00a0the subject matter is what you want to get across step away from your nerves and get into the facts you want to present let the material you present be the focus\\\\u00a04 remember everyone else is just as nervous as you\\\\u00a0share your fears with some of your classmates and gain support from them focus on a friendly face during the presentation be a support to them in return5 fake it till you make it\\\\u00a0yes it sounds blunt\\\\u00a0but sometimes thats what it takes even if you feel like it you wont dieso much more can be discussed with a competent counselor take the time to let a professional help you work through thisagain you have come a long way to be in a graduate program congratulations you have done great work so far its just one step at a time take the steps\",\"a good way to start is the language or self talk that is happening inside your mind \\\\u00a0looking at your question when it is said that the presentations make me feel stress you are giving the responsibility of the stress to the presentations and taking that away from your self \\\\u00a0the presentations cannot give or take away your stress thats something only you can do and you can do it \\\\u00a0 what language can you change in your self talk \\\\u00a0for example are you saying i cant speak in front of an audience ill fail \\\\u00a0that sounds a lot different than i studied my butt off and if i practice speaking out loud i can ace this presentation \\\\u00a0although this is a short answer i do believe that counseling will help you overcome these stressful feelings and bring out your inner confidence\",\"first of all way to go in stretching yourself out of your comfort zone you are sure to grow through all of this practice presenting to your peers and that in itself will help to grow your confidence over time in the meantime do whatever you can to help yourself feel prepared for each presentation do your work ahead of time so that you feel wellinformed on your topic and then spend the days leading up to your presentation practicing do your presentation in the mirror while you are driving if it wont distract you from the road and practice in front of a friend on the day of the presentation eat a balanced meal get a pep talk from a supportive friend use deep breathing to keep your body calm and remind yourself that you are prepared you got this\",\"have you tried rehearsing to yourself or a trusted friend what you will present to the class \\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0the more confident you feel in a safe space the more chance there will be of making the same presentation to a larger groupgiving presentations is not necessarily a difficulty with communication \\\\u00a0 it has more to do with performance than expressing yourself clearlypractice practice and practice until you see yourself improve in how you presentalso keep in mind that whatever anxiety you may feel about making a mistake the audience is almost alway much more forgiving than the person who feels anxiousanxiety heightens fear so whatever concerns you have check if they are growing from anxiety instead of a realistic assessment of your abilities or audience receptivitygood luck\",\"i

embarrassment and selfblame often have thoughts like how could i do that i looked so stupid now people saw things i did not want them to see if we tune in more we might notice we are thinking that this is terrible horrible and that we cannot deal with it these are selfsabotaging thoughts that lead to shame selfblame and embarrassment if you look at the evidence you can find more rational thoughts such as  we all make mistakes people can look all different ways at different time  this incident does not define me and if someone has a bad image or thought about me it is really ok people have all kinds of thoughts about other people and it does not have to be a major problem when you practice your rational thoughts often and replace the negative ones you will start to feel better more confident and your embarrassment will decrease quickly\",\"first of all congratulations to you on becoming a water safety instructoras far as how to forgive yourself this is probably one of the toughest things that we ask of ourselves no matter the subject on the other hand it sounds like the location of the mistake means that after you get through the class you wont see the same people much

intentional i think we have all had a swimsuit shift in unwanted directiontrying to make sure that the same thing doesnt happen again would probably be helpful but it sounds like you are already doing

hear the truth of your relationship with their father but wait until they ask trust that they have their own experience of their dad and trust that he doesnt have the power to destroy their love for you children in the long term lose respect for parents who denigrate the other parent they see who their dad is already id bet but they dont know how to cope with that if hes the only one fighting a war youre helping them feel less trapped in a parental conflict dont engage on his level\\\\u00a0dont blame your children completely although i have to say that for them to call you names like crazy is not acceptable and you dont need to tolerate that disrespect try to deal with this behaviour without bringing their dad into it they are acting out their fathers agenda likely because they

isnt the answer but have compassion for their position this picture isnt their fault but as adults they can be held accountable for their choicesreassure yourself that you are the mom you know you are you dont need them to gush all over you in order to know that you made sacrifices hold onto the likelihood that some day they will come back and be grateful it may take a while you cant rush it but

would encourage you to speak up about your contributions to your boss often overworked and underpaid also includes the my boss never notices me and that can demoralizing if we feel appreciated that can go a long way ive found that it is quite common for bosses to require some instruction for how to show each of their employees appreciation and it goes deeper than thank you or taking you out to lunch  its almost something felt as opposed to made explicitbut sometimes appreciation isnt going to do the trick either because that overworked and underpaid actually has led you to feel burnout you

with them will likely be of great benefit\\\\u00a0choose a time to talk with them\\\\u00a0about heated issues when everyone is calm and emotions are not heightened use i phrases by telling them how the arguments effect you as opposed to placing blame on them\\\\u00a0validate what you hear your parents say in order to allow them to know that you understand their point of view2 when you feel yourself becoming angry take a break simply excuse yourself from the situation find a quiet place to be by yourself and do some deep breathing close your eyes slowly count to four as you inhale and exhale\\\\u00a0even slower counting to 6 focus on nothing except for your breathing and do this for 5 minutes3 stop any negative thoughts in their tracks often times when we get upset we catastrophize and do not see things clearly when you catch yourself thinking negatively stop the thoughts and ask yourself if your thinking is logical and rational if you cannot find much or any evidence that your thoughts are valid then let them go and replace them with realistic logical thoughts4 finally find a friend or someone to talk to andor keep a journal keeping your emotions to yourself will not help

there could be some people in your life for whom empathy is easier to feel and those for whom you have no idea what they are experiencingempathy is not usually categorized as an emotion but as something related to emotions for example you could have empathy about someones anxietyim not sure whether you are also referring to the idea that you dont have sympathy for yourself or others thats a different concept but also involves different degreeswhen you say you dont have emotion except anxiety i wonder if you are saying that you have anxiety all the time and it may be covering up other emotions if you are experiencing a lot of anxiety try to look at what it connects to and find something that changes your focus for a few minutes this could be any number of activities such as watching tv cooking reading a book or many other optionsif you are feeling as if you are just going through the motions and not having a lot of emotions about anything if its just been a few days it may just be related to a current stress that will lessen in a few days if it has been quite a while consider tracking your mood and looking at when you do notice changes in your emotions there may be some variations that you are not aware ofif you continue to feel anxious and as if you dont have as many emotions as you would like consider talking with your primary care physician or a local

ever done anything questionable that would cause you to not trust her if so then it will take time and some work to gain the trust back couples counseling would be of benefit if not then you may want

issue is not likely to get resolved in the meantime i suggest that when youre feeling upset and are unable to trust what your wife saysdoes think before you speak ask yourself if you have valid reasons to not trust her instead of arguing try and communicate how youre feeling and let her know that resolving this trust issue will be a top priority for you so that you can focus on other aspects of your relationship hope it all works out for you both\",\"instead of fighting about trust is it possible for you and your wife to talk with other about areas which upset each of youwhenever feelings

ever really liked at all\",\"Response\":[\"not liking someone is not cruel  even if it is a family member there is nothing wrong with you for not liking your sister some people are fortunate to have siblings that they get along with really well other dont we all have different personalities and we are not going to like everyone  even if they are related in fact sometimes being related makes it harder because you know all of each others flaws and imperfections with that being said  it may be worth it to make an effort to talk about the things that get in the way of having the kind of relationship that you might ideally want with your sister sometimes it is hard to like someone if we have a lot of old frustration and resentment and being able to talk about it in a constructive and kind way can lead to more understanding and respect and sometimes actually liking each other\",\"hi my guess is theres a lot of deep history here that i dont know about have you felt hurt by your sister in the past or are you just different people its a common feeling people have about siblings that theyre very different and they wouldnt choose them as friends but most people stay connected to family unless theres a good reason not to we dont choose our family do we your feelings are normal and they dont make you cruel if you were mean to her that might be a different thing it might be considered cruel to cut her out of your life for no reason but choosing to not hang out with her a lot isnt cruel in my mind perhaps you at least owe your sister kindness and respect if she respects you but not necessarily friendship\\\\u00a0how you respond here is up to you there are no rules you get to decide how much family means to you and how much time you spend with friends or family this may shift at different times in your life though cutting all ties with a sister now you havent said you want that though might mean she wont want to be there for you in the future when you need her also how you treat your sister affects your other family members as well there are many things to consider here but the bottom line is that you get to surround yourself with the people you want in your life\",\"no one can force emotions \\\\u00a0 its fine to not love your sisteryou may make some discoveries about yourself and your relationship with your sister by studying the reasons for why youre not closeusually this has something to do with how the parents positioned the kids \\\\u00a0some parents obviously favor one child over another and this would heavily influence how the kids view

is a family member there is nothing wrong with you for not liking your sister some people are fortunate to have siblings that they get along with really well other dont we all have different

being said  it may be worth it to make an effort to talk about the things that get in the way of having the kind of relationship that you might ideally want with your sister sometimes it is hard to like someone if we have a lot of old frustration and resentment and being able to talk about it in a constructive and kind way can lead to more understanding and respect and sometimes actually liking

have picked someone else to do it i feel like they just want nothing to do with me\",\"Response\":[\"it sounds like you have the perception that people are frequently disappointed in you wish you were different or someone else and ultimately reject you one question i would have for you is what is your evidence that people feel this way is there anything in peoples words or behaviors that gives you this impression if your not sure it may be useful for you to try to notice what people say and do in response to you even though you perceive these attitudes within them additionally working with a competent therapist may be a great way to get an answer to your question as well as developing ways to move forward with that answer and gain a sense of selfesteem and security in your relationshipsone possibility that comes to mind of which there may be more is that as we grow up we often develop relational templates or sets of expectations about how people are and will relate to us which influence our experiences and behavior in relationships sometimes the templates that we develop to stay connected growing up are not particularly adaptive for adult life and can hamper our selfesteem and capacity for comfortable intimacy as an adult you ask a great question here and one that can be very hard to see through given the difficulty of feeling that people think of you in this

the first step you want to not hate yourself selfacceptance is hard and its on a spectrum on one side we have selfhate on the other extreme selflove and then there is all this stuff in the middle it kind of looks like thisand working toward selflove often means moving around through all these becoming aware of your emotions exploring the parts of you you that easier and harder to accept selfkindness selfforgiveness selfcompassion and ultimately selflove it is a recovery process and has to be an active thing each day meeting with a counselor can give you a partner in that process your counselor can also help you to recognize pieces that may be more difficult to see from your eyes as they have an outside view and with selfacceptance confidence comes naturally although you may need to practice behaviors that show assertiveness confidence and boundaries that protect you wishing you the absolute best with this\",\"selfdoubt and selfhatred are such common and unpleasant experiences and really worth \\\\u00a0understanding therapy with the right person can really help when in your life do you feel the most confident what gets in the way of you accepting and loving yourself big question you can and will uncover that confident self\",\"self love and self acceptance is something that many of my clients struggle with so i can assure you that you are not alone we are bombarded by media and advertisements everyday that try to sell us things to make us somehow better thus leading us to believe that we are not enough unfortunately i believe that low self esteem is a social epidemicon a more personal level do you have any sense of what types of messages you have received in your life that have led to these self defeating thoughts for example did a parent or another loved one criticize you or put you down often were you bulled in school has a romantic partner emotionally abused you usually there are factors such as these which insidiously lead to low self esteem and self loathing once you can identify some of the factors that lead to your self hatred you can make a decision to not let these things from your past have such power over you any more you learn to take control of how you feel about yourself rather than letting others dictate that for you\\\\u00a0i do think it is possible to heal from self hatred it doesnt happen over night and it takes time and effort it is about retraining your brain to focus on your strengths rather than on your weaknesses none of us are ever going to be perfect and if we look for a flaw we are bound to find one or two or three try keeping a self esteem journal every night write down three things that you were proud of that day about yourself try reciting positive affirmations every day such as i am lovable and beautiful just the way that i am today to reprogram your mind into thinking highly of yourself rather than poorly\",\"the most important word here is sometimes i know it is quite painful and i can imagine that at times this pain doesnt feel like it will subside but it sounds like it is not all the time which means we can easily say that this hate myself experience is one part of you there are many other parts if you give them some space to also speak up that will offer you more positive regard trust me on that generally speaking we just dont know how to listen to those parts becauseit is the i hate myself part that is our inner critic and often our inner critic has developed a lot of strength throughout our life because of how weve depended on it for certain things sounds crazy but in actuality some of the most successful people in work mainly are those that have strong inner critics they use these critics to motivate themselves but with people and in relationships and in our relationship with ourselves it completely backfires because relationships are far more dynamic processes than doing well at workso try to acknowledge that the inner critic is one part of you that youve learned to give a lot of space to but if you sit with even a remotely positive feeling you have it can also be given the space to speak up and grow just like the critic has over time\",\"the answer would require a more indepth knowledge of you and your situation\\\\u00a0a lot of times these feelings are the result of the people in your life treating you a certain way you internalize it and accept it as your reality\\\\u00a0the first step is to evaluate the people close to you especially your parents even if you are an adult think back to your childhood children who grow up in an unstable home often grow up to be adults with insecurities and emotional problems the obvious such as being abused can certainly lead to a person having little to no confidence and self esteem but there are other situations that might surprise you to hear they can be damaging to a personyou may have never been physically or sexually abused but what about emotionally were you yelled at berated put down were you told youd never amount to anything were you compared to siblings and felt like you always fell short couldnt live up to expectations when you hear something over and over again you start to believe itmaybe you werent yelled at maybe it was the opposite studies show that children who grow up with a parent who is depressed show signs of emotional neglect a chronically depressed mother for example may have seemed cold detached emotionless she may have been less likely to show interest in a childs life not give praise for accomplishments or show support by going to ballgames or performances\\\\u00a0if one of your family members were chronically ill while you were growing up chances are a lot of the attention went to them which could have led to your needs not being metany of these situations could cause a person to grow up feeling unimportant unheard unloved or like they dont mattermaybe nothing ive described here fits your situation if you cant pinpoint what has caused you to feel this way on your own a counselor can helpi am not saying blame it on your parents or telling you theres nothing you can do to change it quite the opposite understanding why you feel that way is a first step towards making the changes needed to feel better cognitive behavior therapy focuses on cognition  figure out the why then behavior  the how\",\"this happens slowly and can be doneyou already are at the first step of realizing that you hate yourself not that the feelings of selfloathing are the best of what youre able to expect from lifea way to start building confidence is to pay close attention to the way you handle interactions and make decisionsif you start to notice what youd like from an interaction and afterwards reflect on how well you handled yourself especially with any unexpected circumstances youll build confidence in your ability to be good at somethingdo you know why you hate yourselfthis answer may help you address within yourself  a new type self talk

its the overtness of the emotion or how we allow it to manifest that gets us in trouble being able to control your temper depends on several variables how you saw anger acted out as a child in terms of your primary caregivers and what you internalized as being normal in terms of managing conflict and your communication style regarding how you confront problematic situations there are some whose anger takes on a volcano effect whereby they dont readily address problematic situations but rather they continue to stuff their emotion until the right trigger causes them them to explode and then there are those who are very impulsive in terms of how they react to stressful situations they dont take time to think out situations or to make sense of them they just impulsively respond i would encourage you to seek anger management from a therapist who utilizes a cognitive behavioral approach in order that you may explore how your irrational thinking related to certain situations may be influencing your problematic behavior in addition i would encourage you to engage in activities that promote stress reduction if your blowups are indeed related to being overly stressed the first step is recognizing that you have a problem that you need help in understanding and addressing which you have now take the next step in finding a therapist in order that you may learn to control your temper and undo some faulty wiring that may be related to how you process emotion and communicate that youre angry remember anger is the overt expression of some other emotion ie disappointment hurt frustration etc hope this helps\",\"well yes of course it scares them\\\\u00a0 they see someone they love behaving is frightening ways\\\\u00a0 thats a good reason to want to manage your emotions

specializes in working with anxiety disorders and most importantly one with whom you feel comfortable within my practice i educate clients about their anxiety and discuss building a framework with helpful tools for decreasing anxiety1 starting a daily mindfulness practice for example listening to guided meditation engaging in deep breathing exercises yoga practice or other positive calming activities2 understand your negative and positive thoughts many times we tend to focus on the potential for bad things to happen increase positive selftalk when feeling down or when anxious for example i dont need to worry i am calm and relaxed 3 exposure to fearful or anxious situations this can be accomplished under the care of a mental health professional many times we shy away from things that make us feel uncomfortable or insecure this may led to an increase in isolating behaviors resulting in difficulty in performing things we were once able to do for example leaving the house presenting in front of others going to social events and having conversations with people however the more we expose ourselves and practice the use of our positive coping skills ex deep breathing the chances of anxiety will decrease i hope this was helpful keep in mind a therapist can help with guiding you through self relaxation and improvement\",\"the other two post answers to your question are

occurred\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0working with someone who utilizes a behavioral approach such as dbt or behavioral analysis you can find solutions that replace one of the links and therefore breaks the chain of events\",\"anxiety is simply your system communicating to you that you are in danger the issue that i see in most of my clients is that they try to reason with this anxiety you do not reason with sensory states in the body if your system tells your in danger your stomache feels like it is knots your heart is beating out of your chest validate by just being present with it take your breath to it breath in and out of that space say ok i am in danger i always tell my clients a crying baby wants to be held not told to shut up listen to your system validate it like you do a child and see what happens\",\"the are two ways that such anxiety can be dealt with one is an attempt to replace maladaptive thinking by examining the distorted thinking and resetting the fightorflight response with more reasonable accurate ones as an example im scared of spiders but if you change the thinking from being scared to im bigger than the spider it allows the mind to reach a calmer state of mind\\\\u00a0mindfulnessbased therapy can also help \\\\u00a0focus on the bodily sensations that arise when you feel anxious instead of avoiding or withdrawing from these feelings remain present and fully experience the symptoms of anxiety instead of avoiding distressing thoughts open up to them in an effort to realize and acknowledge that they are not literally truealthough it may seem counterintuitive fully realizing the experience of anxiety enables the release of over identification with negative thoughts you can practice responding to disruptive thoughts and letting these thoughts goby remaining present in the body youll learn that the anxiety being experienced is merely a reaction to perceived threats by positively responding to threatening events instead of being reactive you can overcome an erroneous fightorflight response\",\"the other two post answers to your question are very good and i dont feel the need to repeat what has already been said quite well but i will offer one other option i have been able to utilize quite successfully with those dealing with panic attacks \\\\u00a0chain analysis is a fantastic way for your to map out the situation starting with the prompting event the chain of events links that lead up to the behavior  in this case a panic attack and then what the consequences were \\\\u00a0see the illustration belowimg

is simply your system communicating to you that you are in danger the issue that i see in most of my clients is that they try to reason with this anxiety you do not reason with sensory states in the body if your system tells your in danger your stomache feels like it is knots your heart is beating out of your chest validate by just being present with it take your breath to it breath in and out of that space say ok i am in danger i always tell my clients a crying baby wants to be held not told to shut up listen to your system validate it like you do a child and see what happens\\\\u00a0\"]}\\n{\"Context\":\"i get very nervous and anxiousscared before sex\",\"Response\":[\"tell your partner about this so that ideally the person has a chance to be supportive and reassuring as well as listen to your specific worries and fearsinitiate this type of discussion at a time which is removed from the time youre about to have sexthis way you and your partner both have a chance to realize the two of you are having a discussion \\\\u00a0not a prelude to sexif you meant in your question that you feel anxious about having sex w a random partner then maybe you are less interested in hookup sex than you imagined\",\"i first wonder what your anxiety or fear connects to i dont know whether it is about sex itself or about ideas of worthiness or feeling desirablethere is also a difference between having selfdoubt about the actual physicality of having sex performancerelated or having doubts about whether you want to have sex with a particular personhaving sex can lead to feelings of great vulnerability if your partner is someone you trust consider discussing what it is that comes up for you around the issue of sex this is the certain things that your partner would be willing to do that and the ease your discomfort like staying with you for some time before and after sexual interactionsanother idea to consider is spending time with your partner and using nonsexual touch for each other perhaps first you to him and then him to you and communicating very clearly about what you like and do not like some people like to be spoken to during physical touch and other people do not all of this can be part of your discussions when you feel comfortable with that you could move into sexual touch in this manner and actually look at what you do and do not like you may also consider discussing things that are totally offlimits for you all the time and things for which you would like warning or awareness before they happen there are really a number of different ways to work on becoming more comfortable if you trust your partner and if your concern is about sex itselfif this feels pretty structured it is initially generally the idea is to learn more about each other and yourselves and then the process becomes much more naturalif the concern relates more to selfesteem related sex consider asking your partner to list several things that he or she likes about you even if you dont necessarily see yourself in the same light consider that this is how your partner sees you so these are some of the things that make you attractive to them perhaps both in sexual ways and in a wider discussion of the relationshipif this is difficult for you to sort out on your own consider seeing a therapist with experience working with couples or relationships\"]}\\n{\"Context\":\"i got married in 2014 i have a two year old son his mom and i decided to separate due to my infidelities weve tried to reconcile our differences but it never works out since weve been separated ive dated someone and we are expecting a baby girl is this something i should mention to my wife the current woman whom im dating has been telling me for months to break up with her but its hard because i actually love her\",\"Response\":[\"my answer is yes you should tell her because you have a child with her she is the mother of your son and this new baby would be his half sister i think telling her is mature and appropriate usually procrastinating just makes it worseanother thing to consider would you want her to tell you if she was pregnant with her boyfriends baby hope this helps take care\",\"only tell your former girlfriend who is the mother of your son what is necessary for her to know as it relates to your sonthe mother of your son has every right as a parent to know who is directly involved in her sons lifefirst figure out how you will handle your current girlfriends request to end the relationship you have with herwithout knowing whether you are in a relationship or not is a key piece of information which the mother of your son would likely have interest to know and be entitled to knowalso love is never enough to keep a marriage working \\\\u00a0love is a wonderful emotion only managing daily life and family decisions requires commitment to the other personreflect within yourself if you are willing to commit to your current girlfriend \\\\u00a0 then youd have a substantial offer to make to her of your willingness to be together with her\"]}\\n{\"Context\":\"i got sick really bad and was throwing up for three days

how what can i do\",\"Response\":[\"fears are not that difficult to deal with first you need to train yourself to relax using some relaxation strategy once you are able to employ that in your daily life you then need to start facing your fear for instance ill use an example of a man who has a fear of driving over a bridge we would build a hierarchy of fears that is a list of fears ranging from least to most for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique then moving closer to the bridge then maybe standing on a bridge all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge or you can also engage in flooding which is for example if you were scared of an elevator go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore in the movie batman begins bruce wayne who has a great fear of bats goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them secondly look at your fears do they even need to be worked on some fears are healthy for example if i was a therapist in new york city and someone came to me and said im scared of snakes i would probably say that is ok because there are very little snakes left in manhattanhope that helps c\",\"your fear may have deeper roots within your sense of who you are than you realize \\\\u00a0 fears are sometimes irrational so that logic doesnt get rid of themthink about whether you felt secure and confident as a child \\\\u00a0also did any major bad events happen to you with other people or situations when you were growing upoften these overwhelming situations of childhood stay with us as fears of situations in our adult lives \\\\u00a0if the root of the problem w the fear is from long ago then probably a therapist who can ask you questions which help you remember upsetting childhood circumstances may help you to dissolve the current fearanother possibility is cbt cognitive behavior therapy which teaches people short term mantras to do something which is safe say being a passenger in a commercial airplane which feels frightening to a personcbt is short term and results are limited to specific fears \\\\u00a0it is a much quicker approach than selfunderstanding\",\"fear is a part of life in fact our five main emotions are joy fear sadness shame and anger we tend to spend a lot of time and energy running away from or trying to get rid of most of those emotions and the more we do that the more we set ourselves up for failure and disappointment\\\\u00a0as a result of viewing our human emotions as bad or wrong we often get caught up in a trap of thinking we have to overcome them or get rid of them before we can do what matters to us in reality you can do what is important to you while\\\\u00a0having your fears\\\\u00a0my question for you is what would you do if this fear was completely gone what behaviors would you have if you were the ideal you what skills knowledge or personal qualities would you develop what kind of relationships would you havei imagine your fear has kept you from achieving those goals because your mind tells you you cant do it until the fear is gone i challenge you to do the following exercisewhat is a goal you would like to achieve example i would like to change careerswhat actions are necessary to complete this goal example see a career counselor to determine my ideal career go back to schoolget a certification network with others in my desired industrywhat thoughts feelings or urges might get in my way example thoughts of what if i fail im not smart enough i cant do it im too busy to put energy into this feelings of fear shame excitement urges to distract myself through drinking or watch tv instead of taking actionit would be helpful to remind myself that example it is natural to have these thoughts feelings and urges but i can take action anyway i deserve to have a fulfilling lifethe smallest and easiest step i can take now example research career counselors in my area and write down their phone numbersthe time day and date that i will take that first step is example tonight at 7pm\\\\u00a0at least think through these answers but it is most beneficial to write them down i hope this helps\",\"this answer could be very different depending on the fear the degree of it and what it connects toi wonder the followingon a scale of 1 to 10 how upset anxious or scared to you get when you think about overcoming this if its more than a 510 i would definitely recommend talking with a therapist in your areaa lot of fears that we have come from something that at one time was selfprotective and important do you know where your fear started if you think it is still protecting you or helping you in some way talk with someone like a therapist about itif it is something that you know is irrational for example fear of being hurt by static cling from winter clothing is there some part of that that you are not afraid ofi really encourage you to consider whether your fear has a lot of emotions connected to it or if it ties from something in your past that was very emotional for you at the time if it does consider working with a therapist to establish emotional safety before taking away the fear or anxiety that may actually be helpful to youalso the fact that you notice that you are afraid of something and you dont want to be afraid of it anymore is a big step in the forward direction\",\"biologically fear is designed to protect us from harm fear is not always a bad thing and in fact can be quite healthy and appropriate depending on the situation\\\\u00a0a phobia however is different you used the term fear rather than phobia a phobia is an irrational fear  meaning it is not rational for you to fear that thing if your situation is a phobia exposure therapy can help this consists of gradually exposing yourself a little at a time to the thing you are afraid of some people with phobias find that the irrational fear interferes with their life and they do need to overcome it someone who is afraid to drive over bridges may go to great lengths to avoid routes that have bridges people who are afraid of elevators may always use the stairs instead which may not always be feasible if overcoming a phobia will improve the quality of your life then by all means seek professional help to overcome iteveryone has fears or things that make them nervous public speaking asking a person out fear of failure examine what your fear is and try to determine the reason for the fear when you can get to the root cause of the fear you can deal with that issue a lot of times it is a selfesteem issue you may be able to peel back the layers of the fear and find out whats causing it and deal with the real issue\\\\u00a0some fears are caused by trauma someone with ptsd is going to have an exaggerated fear response and will find themselves being kicked into fight or flight mode over things that someone without the trauma experience wouldnt notice or react to in cases like this exposure therapy would be the wrong approach and could actually make things worse if there is a possibility that a past trauma is the cause of your fear i strongly urge you to seek a therapist  not just any therapist but one who is trained to work with trauma and abuse victims\",\"hello and thank you for your question overcoming fears is something that everyone struggles with at one time or another sometimes we come across something that scares us we push through it and suddenly we arent afraid anymore but sometimes it can seem like our fears just take over and we cannot overcome them there are some options1 you can go to a counselor and receive some type of treatment what kind of treatment would depend on the type of fears you are experiencing for example if you have a general phobia about something they may use various techniques to help you manage it\\\\u00a0 2 there are different websites and even some selfhelp books that you can use to try to overcome your fears when it comes to overcoming certain fears or phobias exposure therapy wellstudied and proven to work a therapist would help you with this but some websites give instructions

and he is entitled to his feelings if you are in a relationship with him he may be out of line if he assumes that anything happened between you and your ex that would compromise the relationship however your boyfriend being upset might also mean that he wanted to spend that kind of weekend with you and did not get to do thatlong story short it might help your relationship to understand more and be curious not judgey around what is upsetting for him perhaps having empathy for his experience of the behavior could help him to feel more secure with you having relationships with your

that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming anxiety is our brains way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action\\\\u00a0some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple the first id recommend is a calm breathing technique  breathe in for 45 seconds and then out for 78 seconds try to repeat this for 35 minutes another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe  without judging  the sensations to yourself try to be very specific such as my palms are feeling very sweaty and i can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad  just experiencing them as intentionally as possible \\\\u00a0combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful\\\\u00a0if you feel that these techniques dont help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to then id highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional this professional can help you determine if therapycounseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms\",\"anxieties

protected as service animsls even though that can be very helpful emotional support animals are not generally protected in the same wayyou might not be able to make your landlord accommodate you if

defines as disabled are protected under specific laws and must be accommodated in public places where the human they serve is present\\\\u00a0while it may be beneficial to request that the therapist who prescribed the dog to you write a letter to the apartment manager it sounds like the manager is aware of ada guidelines and the simplest course of action may be to find an alternative residence if that is a plausible option\",\"agree with the apartment managers viewpoint that your disability is not a physical limitationask the manager if theyd accept an explanatory letter from a therapist who is licensed to diagnosis emotional disabilitiesif the answer is yes then find a therapist whos willing to cooperate with what you need from them and find out this particular therapists terms of working with you to compose such a letterif the manager tells you no then find out who is above this person or entity and find out how to formally introduce your request to the board or apartment owner or whoever actually is the legal owner of the building\",\"this is tricky because there are different types of emotional support dogs the ones that are officially trained actually go through months of training and then are paired with someone for whom they perform specific tasksyou may benefit from looking at the blog written by valerie parrott who has an emotional support dog due to

trouble sleeping for more than a few nights consider talking with your primary care physician not sleeping can really make changes in your emotions seem much largercan you find anything in your life that is the same as it was before the breakup this may be a starting point for you i wonder if you could think of and moment or two each day when you feel emotionally at peace while you are awake also consider looking at things that you can control such as when you choose to wear eat and who you talk to about your deepest feelingsyou mentioned that you have friends and family i wonder if any of

month\",\"Response\":[\"theres a narrative approach that we call nightmare rescripting that may be helpfulsince we cant really control the nature of our dreams while theyre happening we try to alter them while we are in a waking state\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0in a nutshell this refers to first writing out in detail the events of a recurring nightmare you have typically there is an element of fear danger or helplessnesssecond we rescript the nightmare by changing what happens in the dream in a way that engenders feelings of empowerment control competence andor safety in other words if the nightmare involved being pursued or assaulted we might change the events of the story so that you call the police get to a place of safety or even fight back and protect yourselfthird you can reread this new version of the dream over and over again so that it becomes a well rehearsed story the effect of this can make it so that the next time your mind goes towards the nightmare while sleeping this new more hopeful and empowering story competes with the old one and reduces the level of distress associated with the dream best of luck\",\"are you facing any type of overwhelming situation in your waking lifedreams and nightmares are the nonlogical ways in which we make emotional sense of what goes on in our everyday waking worldbesides having some type of relaxing bedtime routine to set a peaceful mood for your sleep and avoiding viewing violent films and video games as entertainment maybe even avoiding news stories which sometimes have similar themes of violence the content of our dreams and nightmares is out of our direct controlyour nightmares may offer useful clues as to what youre trying to resolve in your life \\\\u00a0pay attention to the story of your nightmare because it reflects how you feel in waking lifeif you feel helpless and silenced in your nightmare or taken advantage of or whatever dreadful situation goes on during your nightmare then look for where in

have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about six years now in the past our relationship was difficult and frustrating we argued a lot and due to that there was a lot of tension between us we stayed together because we love each other and wanted to make it work i used to party a lot and several times i got into situations where i would end up kissing someone else these situations were never more than just kissing i have come clean about these situations with my boyfriend and he decided to forgive and move forward with me i love him so much and want to work things out too but im having a difficult time understanding how he can forgive me i cant seem to forgive myself im overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and unworthiness\",\"Response\":[\"hi cerritosthis is an interesting twist because its more common for the person in your position to want to move forward and for the person who was wronged to struggle with forgiveness you are lucky to have a loving compassionate

playing a role here your sense of worthlessness seems out of proportion to the mistakes you made you dont have to be perfect in order to deserve the love of a good man you only have to have the maturity to recognise when youve hurt someone and work hard to make it better who in your life overreacted to small mistakes you made were you shamed as a child did you learn that you deserved to be punished did something bad happen that you thought was your fault is there a mistake you made long ago that you need forgiveness for there is a younger person inside you waiting to be forgiven for something they werent entirely responsible for the bar is too high for you if i was your therapist i would work with you to find the source of the shame and address that wound\\\\u00a0if you want to move forward and be with your boyfriend your job will be to forgive yourself forgiving doesnt mean it was okay forgiving simply means that it happened that you cant erase it and that you dont want to carry it around or punish yourself for it anymore\\\\u00a0you have done many things here that you can feel proud of youve come clean youve been honest youve taken responsibility for your actions youve not tried to minimize what you did and youve chosen to be more loyal and aware of how you impact your boyfriend these are all things you can use to build your sense of worth you are acting very

lot of money but could make each of you feel specialsomething else you could try is to consider talking to each other in a way where you summarize what you are hearing and reflect back to make sure that you got it right rather than just assuming so communicating this way can feel awkward at times but it could reconnect how you are listening and deeply connecting with your partner also you may

cognitive space for your partner and allows them to do the same for you the more you know about each other especially your everyday lives creates a bond between the two of you much like the saying goes in the military the same is true for a couple complacency kills it is important for both of you to invest in each other on a regular basis i regularly recommend that both of you take the 5 love languages assessment and start using each others top love languages to help show each other the positive affection that you feel or at least want to feel for one another start asking about your husbands day trying to learn about all the interactions that he has at work and feel free to ask questions so that he knows you really want to know about him and know him intimately again\",\"feeling alone in your marriage is one of the most painful feelings wanting connection with your spouse yet feeling the all too familiar distance thats keeping you apart can be so hurtful but change is possible you might be able to move closer toward each other on your own but since there has been two years of distance i would suggest looking into couples therapy with a trained couples therapist they are trained in helping couples begin to examine whats been happening that has caused a drift in your marriage\\\\u00a0im also curious if there was a significant event that occurred around the time you started feeling distant if there was something that occurred during this time that is hard for you both to talk about couples therapy can help with this also it can provide a safe and supportive space for you both\",\"absolutely your question shows that you are going through a lot of pain and im sorry for that many couples go through this disconnect and hope to come to reconnect before things get to a breaking point what i think can help is the following\\\\u00a01 understand what his primary concern is2 understand what your primary concern is3 what would you like to see different4 what would he like to see different\\\\u00a05 be honest about your concern with him having friends be ready for honesty6 help him understand you feel alone without him feeling guilty7 let him know how committed you are to making this relationship despite the two of you drifting apart8 sometimes if you just acknowledge the elephant in the room9 couplesmarriage therapy\",\"what you are describing is something i often refer to as living with your roommate phenomenon this is the idea that you feel like you are living with a roommate and no your partner or spouse  it is not uncommon for members of a couple to report to feel both physical andor emotional distance when we dont feel connected within relationships this can be isolating and lonely the emotional distance often makes us wonder am i important to the other these types of feelings need to be better understood in the context of your own background and upbringing ie who you are and also better understood in the context of your couple feeling reconnected can occur but there is not a one size fits all solutoon as a first step do you or your partner have any ideas of how to feel reconnected have you considering talking to your partner about the emotional void or how about discussing \\\\u00a0solutions  together that might help from individual therapy to couple therapy to a weekly date night to inquiring about one anothers personal interest to starting off the conversation of what both of you want and can do to reestablish feelings of connectiveness if this is too frightening ie to address the lack of connection between you and your spouse \\\\u00a0a fist meeting with a couple therapist can likely help unpack what the possible solutions for your couple\",\"i can think of several things that may help you to reconnect i dont know how much time you actually spend together but one thing you could try is to spend 15 minutes a week together talking about common interests or other things that make you feel connectedhave you considered a date night or anything doesnt have to cost a lot of money but could make each of you feel specialsomething else you could try is to consider talking to each other in a way where you summarize what you are hearing and reflect back to make sure that you got it right rather than just assuming so communicating this way can feel awkward at times but it could reconnect how you are listening and deeply connecting with your partner also you may discover that you are on two different pages about things on which you thought you understood what each other felt wanted or desiredconsider what makes your partner feel loved valued appreciated or special can you name a few things and get them right according to your partner when you check in can he do the same for youyou could also try doing two things every day that would be appreciated by your partner without either of you having to ask for it there is some more information here although what you do for one another does not necessarily need to be on this list\\\\u00a0httpwwwcouplesinstitutecomtrackingsuccessbydoingthedailydoublereconnecting is a bit of a process try to praise yourself and your

comes to mind for me but more along the lines of do you want to be together and what kind of relationship do you want to createfor some people polyamorous relationships those involving more than two people are acceptable this does not work for everyone but if each of you agree that that is okay it may work for you and your husband if it is something that you are both open to it is often beneficial to have more than one discussion about the details of what is acceptable for each of youif you want to be devoted only to each other what does that lifestyle look like for each of you what can you start or stop doing right now to move your relationship in that directionneither of you can make the other partner change that does not mean you cannot talk about what each of your goals are together and support each other in working toward those goals you have for yourselvessometime having discussions like these is easier when there is a structure andor someone in the room like a therapist who can help keep the conversation on topic and work on having each of you communicate in a way that expresses your wants wishes and desires in a way that is not blaming of your partnerif

would suggest a couple of things there are a lot of groups or other supports for people who are working through some of the same changes that you may be going through now i dont mean to convey that

particular button isnt functioning window if you search for transgender support on google youll find glaad and pflag both of which are national organizations this does not mean that you have to identify as transgender but researching that term may help you to find both national and local resourcesas far as telling your dad if that is particularly concerning for you i suggest either talking through the details with a local therapist or considering if you have a trusted friend or family member one who will respect your privacy with regard to who you would like to know about what you are experiencing at this time so that you can talk with some people to have support this may help with two things allowing you to find some support for yourself as you work through the changes that you are going through now and also possibly talking with someone who knows your dad and may be able to talk with you regarding how or when to tell himone thing that i tell anyone who wants to discuss something that is very important to them is to ask the person they want to talk to whether this is a good time for an important conversation that way you have greater chances of having the persons

transgender rights is something that is being talked about a lot has he had an opinion this wont tell you for sure if he would be okay with learning you are transgender but at least you would know if

stop when theyve had enough but i keep eating for the pleasure of it especially with sweets  im never done eating dessert\",\"Response\":[\"hello im so glad you decided to write in today this is such a great question and im sure many others will relate to exactly what youre describing there are a few different ways we can look at in understanding your concern\\\\u00a0first i think its important to understand food is just food food is meant to nourish our bodies provide us with energy and yes sometimes reserved for special occasions and celebrations but in many cultures we place a lot of emphasis on food we have food at every gathering and every celebration whats more people have come to almost expect food to be present at any and every gettogether and if its not well then forget about it\\\\u00a0i see this time and time again with my clients donuts appear in the office and its almost like donuts have never been there before must eat one or two\\\\u00a0however we need to remind ourselves that this occurrence or similar ones will not be the last time we can enjoy this particular food it is likely the office donuts have happened before and they will be there again on another day during these moments i like to have my clients employ a stopandthink method stopandthink about your goals before you eat is this donut getting you where you want to be also i have my clients ask themselves how special is this donut if the donut really is a special donut from the best bakery in town and youve never been there before then now might be a time to have the donut but if not it would be wise to pass and wait until that special donut\\\\u00a0another aspect we need to remember about food is to think about what were getting from overindulging or overeating are you trying to drown out other emotions are you trying to feel better and the food gives you that feeling for a brief moment what else is going on this can be determined by utilizing what we describe as a thought record a thought record involves tracking and identifying thoughts and feelings associated with food triggers by targeting the emotions we can then determine where theyre coming from as well as how to decipher them a therapist can also help you with understanding your emotions related to food and will be helpful in assisting you with the thought recordthe most important thing to remember is that food addiction can be a real problem for a lot of people if food is taking over your life and you are preoccupied and overwhelmed with knowing where to start please seek out help binge eating is the

many issues to address in counseling\",\"Response\":[\"let me start by saying there are never too many concerns that you can bring into counselling in fact most people who come to see me for counselling have more than one issue they would like to work on in psychotherapy and most times these are all interconnected in counselling we work together collaboratively to figure out which issues you would like to address first and then together we develop an individualized plan of care basically its like a road map of where you want to go how are you going to get there looking at stopovers some scenic routes others possibly not so scenic however necessary of course these plans can also change due to internal what we have control over like our thoughts feelings and behaviours or external reasons those things that are outside our control i would encourage you to take the next step and reach out to a professional you can trust and build rapport with by cojourneying through whatever concerns you have by examining what has been working so far as you have learned to cope with some of your issues like insomnia depression and anxiety as well as being a breast cancer survivor then to help you by developing new coping strategies psychotherapy can be such a powerful tool to help you get to where it is you want to be i know you can do it and you will see firsthand how psychotherapy will help you to move past these points in your life where you are feeling stuck\\\\u00a0i like to quote nike where their motto is\\\\u00a0just do it\\\\u00a0you can do it\",\"it is never too late to get help and begin making significant changes and improvements in your life \\\\u00a0the right time is when you feel ready and open to change \\\\u00a0sometimes when we have a history of trauma like

much and it sounds like you have a lot of things that have complied over the years regardless of the struggles you have been through you do not have too many issues for counseling many times when someone starts out their counseling and healing journey there are multiple things they would like to address and work on if you decide to start counseling you and your therapist can decide collaboratively what you would like to process and work on first be sure to express to your counselor if any of the above experiences youve been through is causing a lot of distress  as many times the first things addressed are the ones that are presently affecting your life or you emotionally\\\\u00a0often times when we experience negative situations in our life  but do not address them they bottle up inside us and can manifest in other ways such as depression or even physical symptoms like ibs or neck pain\\\\u00a0 counseling can give these bottled up emotions and situations a release given the situation you shared not only do i not think that you have too many issues for counseling but believe that you will be a great candidate and can get a lot from it\",\"absolutely not\\\\u00a0 i strongly recommending working on one issueneed at a time\\\\u00a0 in therapy you will set smart goals and objectives that will help you reach your goals\\\\u00a0 i see you as a survivor and not a victim\\\\u00a0 best wishes to you\",\"absolutely not \\\\u00a0in fact most people have many issues \\\\u00a0a lot lot of the issues you are describing commonly go hand in hand  in therapy speak we call it comorbid conditionsi would venture that most of the feelings you are struggling with stem from your early trauma \\\\u00a0you would benifit tremendously from counseling \\\\u00a0a good therapist will develope a treatment plan that addresses all of your needs with help you could definitely live a happy life without all of your anxiety and depression getting in the way\",\"this is a great question i personally dont believe that any client could ever have too many issues for counseling in fact that type of thinking may be stopping you from seeking counseling so it may be hindering you from getting the help you need in fact all of what you described points to the importance of you seeking help in order to cope with the many challenges in your life\\\\u00a0if you seek counseling it will be important for you to understand that you may need to remain in counseling for a sustained period of time in order to work through each of these issues all of these issues wont be able to be solved right away or in a brief period of time counseling will take commitment and hard work but it is possible for you to recover and heal from all of the issues you describedmany clients come into counseling with numerous issues rather than just one particular thing most of the time the issues relate to and exacerbate each other we call these comorbid conditions which means that two or more mental health problems exist at one time a lot of the times when you start to work on one issue the other issues get better as a resulti encourage you to find a professional therapist that can help you learn how to cope with all of the mental health difficulties that you described you deserve the help just as much as anyone else\",\"hi many people begin their therapeutic journey with histories just like yours and experience transformative shifts in their quality of life \\\\u00a0i hope you are able to find a counselor you feel comfortable working with and do the work if you feel called best of luck on your journey\",\"absolutely not it sounds like you have significant trauma and it will continue to impact your depression until it is dealt with everybody has issues though some more traumatic than others yet it is best to just start somewhere i would encourage you to begin counseling and work through some of your history at your own pace in order to begin to impact and reduce your depressive symptoms\",\"most clients have many issues that need working out it is normal to have many events in our lives that trouble us and remain with us without counseling help the right type of counsellor will help you focus on the main and most troubling issue you have first and work your way through all that you are managing step by step goal by goal\\\\u00a0sometimes working on\\\\u00a0 one issue helps to bring other issues to light in the context of your main problem this can help you resolve some other issues that are connected look for someone with experience and specialty in your most pressing issueeven though you have had breast cancer you may find that grief from your past is more troubling then you would look for a bereavement or grief specialist\",\"just go you start with the most prevalent issue by talking with your therapist healing one issue can have a ripple effect and heal other issues as well\",\"there is no such thing as too many issues for counseling many issues are often interrelated and can all be worked on with some time and patience\",\"hi people who have only a few issues and people who have several issues are perfect for therapy there is no such thing as having too many problems for therapy therapy is great because it will help you process all that you are going through heal from past and present pain and gain clarity\",\"yeah you might at least it certainly feels like that i betnot to mention that most counselors out there might generally feel overwhelmed with a case with so many problems\\\\u00a0 and so you will slog along weektoweek with gradual improvements occurring as she slowly does her best to chip awaythe real issue is that these folks dont yet comprehend the integrative nature of each of these subjects and how generally simple it is to understand them and then eradicate them\",\"it could be said that you might be the perfect candidate for counseling no one is beyond hope and someone brave enough to be honest regarding their struggles with the intention of reaching out for help is certainly a person a qualified counselor would be happy to assist you may want to do some research on therapists in your local area who specialize in mindbody connection or one of the struggles you have acknowledged in your post in order to find a therapist that is best suited to meet your needs\\\\u00a0good luck on your search and remember that the world is a better place with you in it\",\"no there are never too many issues to address in counseling\\\\u00a0 therapy would begin by prioritizing what you feel needs to be addressed first\\\\u00a0 as one area improves such as processing history of abuse you are likely to see improvement in other areas of your lifelike sleeping better\",\"firstly i would like to say how amazing that you have been able to live through breast cancer sexual abuse as well as your depression and anxiety you are stronger than you may believe at this moment for being able to continue to grow and live through these experiences take a moment to acknowledge your strength and know that this strength will be an asset during the therapeutic process that you will be able to tap into to find increased self esteem and more strength to address the concerns you are having there are never too many concerns to address in therapy sessions i hope you can find a great therapist who you can trust to listen and work with you to identify and address\\\\nthe most concerning issues first once you begin to do this you may find an alleviation of symptoms and feelings which could allow you to grow your capacity to manage difficult feelings and situations and address additional concerns before you even realize it the issues you are having will begin to feel more manageable\",\"absolutely not it is never too much the most important thing is that you are reaching out to get help \\\\u00a0therapy helps you to develop healthier coping strategies and that can help reduce the anxiety and depression as well as improve your sleep this can all be done at a pace that is best for you your therapist can help you process all of this in a safe and supportive space\",\"no it is natural for us to have a number of issues going on if we dont address the concerns we have in our lives seeking counseling can assist you in working on these issues individually as well as ways in which they intersect and impact each other\",\"the most direct answer is no i would venture to guess that several of the things you are feeling symptoms are connected i would recommend a trauma counselor you have several strengths resources that you are able to pull from and i would encourage you to focus on them as you deal with the issues you have placed on the back burner for so long sometimes people are afraid to address things because they feel or believe that they wont be able to handle it compare it to a tornado the storm has passed but you are still in hiding for fear of the aftermath the mess left behind a good therapist is like a personal organizer to help you\",\"its not really a question of whether you have too many issues for counseling but more what would you like to work on in counseling you control the direction of sessions and depending on how youre feeling in a particular day can predict what direction that session takes if you want to work on all the issues youve listed it will just take some dedication on your part to see through the counseling long enough to find a resolution to each of the issues that is satisfactory to you you work at your own pace in counseling and it does seem like you may be overwhelmed with the evergrowing list but you may just be in search of self improvement and making yourself better which is a great thing it seems as though you may need some form of resolution to what has happened in the past and to work through the trauma you have experienced that may be the base of your counseling needs in which self esteem and depressionanxiety may fall underneath it as well if you want to start counseling dont let what you need to work on overwhelm you find the counselor that best fits with you and together you both can tackle any issue\",\"a person never has too many issues to address in counseling participating in counseling with a licensed professional offers a safe place and therapeutic relationship where healing can occur\\\\u00a0a trained therapist can help a person unpack and process past andor current wounds or events which may\\\\u00a0 negatively impact day to day living they can also help make sense of thoughts and emotions that sometimes feel overwhelming and confusing\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0if you want to experience more emotional freedom and gain some tools to help understand and cope with depression and anxiety id encourage you to schedule an appointment with a therapist in your area\",\"there is no such things as too\\\\u00a0 many issues many of the issues cited here are connected for example in this case working on the sexual abuse will possibly address the depression the anxiety the self esteem there may be some grief to process around the impact of the cancer our body mind and spirit are parts of one system they are interconnectedaddressing these issue are important so you can be relieved of the burden and feel more spontaneous and enjoy life even more\",\"of course not counseling is a process whereby you and your therapist will help you create goals starting with issues that are most pressing and interfering with your daily functioning when anxiety and daily stress is more manageable then you and your therapist can examine more deep rooted or more chronic issues\",\"you definitely dont have too many issues for counseling in fact counseling can help you understand how most of these things can be related to one another for example insomnia depression low selfesteem and anxiety are very common to experience after a traumatic event or events once you begin to work through processing these life altering events that you have experienced the hope is that you would see a decrease in your other symptoms\",\"you absolutely do not have too many issues for counselling the fact that you are wanting to seek help is commendable and you should feel proud of yourself for reaching out for support i know from my experience working with clients that some may say they have only one issue but when we explore it turns out they have many things that they want to discuss that are of equal importance i believe that you deserve to feel happy at ease and also get restful sleep amongst other things please do not feel hesitant because the fact that you know what you want to discuss and work on is amazing you know the directions you want to go and the therapist just needs to help you get there\\\\u00a0i suggest sitting down and making a list of what you want to discuss as well as what you feel is more important to address first perhaps the therapist can help you with that as well\",\"thank you for sharing your question\\\\u00a0 i imagine it feels overwhelming and discouraging at times if you feel like there are too many issues to address in a counseling session\\\\u00a0 i would encourage you to share these concerns with a counselor because a counselor can help you organize the concerns into a list of specific goals\\\\u00a0 for example a list of goals may look similar to this1\\\\u00a0 i will learn about the effects of medication on the symptoms of depression and anxiety2\\\\u00a0 i will learn about the factors that affect insomnia3\\\\u00a0 i will learn about resources and support groups in my local area to help me cope with my traumatic experiences4\\\\u00a0 i will practice selfcare exercises each day and write about my thoughts and feelings in a journal so i can measure whether or not im making progressthis is an example of some of the possible goals a counselor can help you work toward each week\\\\u00a0 working toward a specific goal can lead to a feeling of accomplishment once youve completed it and this may have a positive impact on your selfesteem\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0i hope this information helps and i wish you all the best\",\"there are never too many issues in living in a way we take on too many issues at one time then we become over whelmed with anxiety and depression\\\\u00a0 a skillful caring therapist will help you find a place to start and deal with one issue at a time when this helps the other issues then the other issues become more manageable i gain confidence i can take on life better and importantly  enjoy living life more my best to you dr spencer\",\"there are never too many issues to be addressed in therapy\\\\u00a0 most people come in with multiple issues they want to address\\\\u00a0 the wonderful thing about therapy is that often as one or more significant issues begin to change and improve\\\\u00a0 \\\\u00a0the lead naturally without much effort to improvements in the other areas\\\\u00a0 for example as you begin to address trauma and betrayal from you past you may find that the insomnia improves your therapist with you input and direction can help you to prioritize which problem areas to target first\",\"you can be helped many of the people i see have multiple issues these issues are often linked so that helping one issue will positively help the other issues\",\"the short answer is absolutely not the longer answer is that it might take some time to process all of the issues and it may feel quite muddy in the issues for a lot longer than is tolerable which is why counseling may have been postponed to begin with for you its important to be realistic when entering counseling of any sort and that the therapist be realistic with you about what you might be able to expect working with that person i use the words might be able to expect because therapy experiences can vary but that not having counseling about trauma that you have experienced much earlier in your life can play a significant role in the process and how long that process could take to unpack all that may have been buried over timeit might also be helpful in counseling to work with the therapist on figuring out where to begin but to also manage the feelings of being overwhelmed that may make it hard to continue to show up and do the work required week in and week out it isnt easy work trying to process past pain that you experienced and so consistent practice of selfcare including leaning on support systems outside of therapy is key\",\"usually people who struggle with depression also have symptoms of anxiety these symptoms come about as a result of underlying causes the obstacles you have been overcoming such as abuse cancer and insomnia likely bring about similar feelings and emotions in you which affect your selfesteem counseling is meant to support people who have layers of difficulties we see the difficulties as layers to an onion peeling away the many layers\",\"often times when an individual begins the counseling process it is revealed that there is more than one thing going on when we think about how much is wrong it can be overwhelming and we may not know where to even start counseling can provide guidance to help you to begin working toward healing in a way that is most helpful for you to reach your goals\",\"it is very common for\\\\u00a0people to have multiple issues that they want to and need to address in counseling\\\\u00a0 i have had clients ask that same question and through more exploration there is often an underlying fear that they\\\\u00a0 cant be helped or that they will be too much for their therapist i dont know if any of this rings true for you but most people have more than one problem in their lives and more often than not\\\\u00a0 people have numerous significant stressors in their lives\\\\u00a0 lets face it life can be complicated therapists are completely ready and equipped to handle all of the issues small or large that a client presents in session most therapists over the first couple of sessions will help you prioritize the issues you are facing so that you start addressing the issues that are causing you the most distress\\\\u00a0 you can never have too many issues to address in counseling\\\\u00a0 all of the issues you mention above can be successfully worked through in counseling\",\"absolutely not when we have the courage to accept the challenge to address whatever is causing us pain the solutions often generalize to many if not all of our symptoms i would suggest that unresolved trauma from sexual abuse is likely a primary contributing factor however it is important that you first build a trusting relationship with a therapist experienced in trauma treatment as this is an area of specialty that not all therapists are skilled in treating choosing one issue to work on such as anxiety or depressive symptoms and starting there will allow you the opportunity to get to know your therapist learn coping skills for managing distressing symptoms and establish emotional safety before jumping into trauma work\",\"hello thereno one has too many issues to address in counseling once you start counseling your therapist will help you identify which issues to start working on first and which are causing you the most distress once you and your therapist prioritize your concerns you can start to address each concern starting with the one causing the most distress for you\",\"it sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed but you are also a survivor and have the benefit of a long stable marriage you do not have too many issues to address in counseling a good therapist will help you to partialize your goals into smaller objectives and focus in on whats most pressing for you to address first in treatment\",\"hello you may have heard the saying that counseling is like peeling the layers of an onion whether a person comes to therapy with many issues on their heart and mind or whether heshe comes with something specific one issue leads to another please dont feel as though you have too many issues you are important and worthy on the plus side \\\\u00a0you are a breast cancer survivor and have a wonderful marriage seek the help that you deserve\",\"you do not have too many issues to address in counseling\\\\u00a0 and your perseverance will serve you well if you choose to engage in therapy\\\\u00a0 the trauma and medical event you experienced topped off with chronic sleepless nights would lead to feelings of depression for many\\\\u00a0 the emotional reaction youve had to these experiences sounds normal albeit troublesome and i would imagine intensely painful at times as well\\\\u00a0 therapy can help prioritize what is the most impactful issue you are grappling with\\\\u00a0 i find in therapy that when the central issue is revealed understood processed and understood again in its current context many other areas of the persons internal experience improve\\\\u00a0 it sounds as though something has prevented you from seeking help from a counselor in the past and it sounds as though you are more seriously considering it now\\\\u00a0 therapy helps and it can help you when youre ready\",\"thank you for sharing your history you do not have too many issues to address in counseling it will help to prioritize what you would like to work on first in therapy your therapist will create a treatment plan with you which can always be changed while working together therapy is a process in working towards your best life and you deserve it\",\"not at all whatever issues you might have you can bring to the therapy room remember therapy is about you not your therapist you bring whatever you need to bring to the table keep in mind these issues are likely related remember you are a holistic being more than just the sum of the parts just like any system when you move something in one area things start changing in other areas as well talk to your therapist to decide goals for counseling and establish priorities and enjoy the ride growing flourishing and finally letting go of what hurts can be a beautiful and exciting process\",\"you absolutely do not have too many issues for counseling your reaching out to ask this question shows you have a resilient spirit also your happy marriage can be a support and strength to you as you embark on a counseling journey i would recommend that you find a counselor who specializes in trauma sexual trauma andor emdr a type of therapy that is proven to have a strong impact on healing from trauma good luck\",\"i dont think you have too many issues for counseling\\\\u00a0 if a client came to me for help with the same issues that you have listed here i would first want them to meet with their doctor to get a physical to rule out any biological causes to your depression anxiety and insomnia\\\\u00a0 i would work with you on deciding which of these issues to tackle first\\\\u00a0 i usually suggest starting with the issue that is easiest\\\\u00a0 reading through your symptoms i might choose anxiety to start with since you are in the early stages of it\\\\u00a0 i like to give my client skills they can use right away so i would focus on teaching you breathing exercises to manage the anxiety as well as cognitive restructuring so that when an anxious thought pops up you can talk yourself through it\\\\u00a0 once you felt that you had some control over the anxiety id start to work on some of your other concerns but i would seek your input on what you felt like might be good to work on next\\\\u00a0 my gut is that some of these issues would be resolved as you worked on others\\\\u00a0 for example as you worked on your anxiety and began to process your trauma and as you began to work on self care and getting more sleep  your self esteem would probably improve\\\\u00a0 i encourage you to meet with a therapist and ask them how they might be able to help you\\\\u00a0 these are just some thoughts that came up for me on how i might help someone with the same or similar symptoms\",\"the way it goes is that all your issues are connected once you work on one issue it will have a positive effect on all areas slowly each issue is addressed and actually less issues will need to be addressed directly since resolving one helps your overall wellness so no you do not have too many issues dont give up get help now and see how your life can change for the better\",\"i think this is a very common question that people who have never been to counseling before have \\\\u00a0there is a lot of anxiety in going to counseling for the first time \\\\u00a0this is normal \\\\u00a0in answer

as welli would encourage you to seek out a counselor whos style and approach speaks to you and start with whichever issue feels most pressing to you a skilled therapist will flow with you at your own

to yourself\",\"there could be many reasons but often people feel validated when they are in a relationship the need to be in a relationship can be related to a belief of unlovability which often stems from our childhood the relationship sort of soothes this temporarily and the others interest or desire helps counteract the ingrained belief there are many questions that may help understand why how was your relationship with your mother caregivers \\\\u00a0how was your childhood etc\\\\u00a0many people describe having a hole or void they try and fill with material things or people but it only is a temporary fix which usually drives the person to the next relationship or object in hopes it will be fulfilling but it never is because fulfillment is work we need to do ourselves this

of you that is looking for support i wonder what it is that you feel when youre not in a relationshipbecause of the way you asked the question im getting the impression that you are referring to romantic relationships i wonder if you have close friendships that could form a network to help with this when you are not romantically involved with someone even when you are in a relationship with a romantic partner having friends is still an important elementi wonder if you could also notice what changes for you inside of yourself as far as emotions when you move from not being in a relationship to being in oneperhaps you could take a look at what you value about yourselfin general it is natural for people to want to be in relationships with others in this case relationship has many meanings

structured initial session that must be done but after that the decisions are largely up to what you and the clinician feel is helping if something is or is not working communicate this with your

context of working through the reasons that brought you into therapy is very important also sometimes anxiety and depression can make it difficult to go to therapy on a regular basis if that is something with which you are struggling i would encourage you to talk about that as wellin addition to a solid relationship with a therapist who you connect with you may consider trying something like

saying it\\\\n   what is wrong with me and how can i stop having these thoughts\",\"Response\":[\"i think we all go through a period of time where we think we arent worth anything sometimes these feelings are a result of low self esteem or because of shame the most important part of dealing with this thought is to separate feelings from reality i dont feel worth anything but i know what i do is important i know who i am matters to others i know i am loved and cared aboutwhen you find yourself having these thoughts stop take a few deep breaths and try to reframe what youre thinking\",\"there is nothing wrong with you sometimes we get intrusive thoughts that can be worrisome one things that can be helpful is to identify if there is a trigger to these thoughts  something in your life that makes these thoughts more common an experience a person a place a situation etc it will also be helpful to try and challenge this type of thinking by focusing on ways in which you are worthwhile as a person and have worth in your life cbt cognitive behavioral therapy may be particularly helpful with this also if you are open to seeing a therapist find one that does cbt you can also find resources on cbt online it focuses on stopping and challenging unhelpful and harmful thinking patterns and replacing it with more helpful and healthy thinking patterns\",\"we all suffer from random thoughts from time to time being able to manage your thoughts and choose what to think about yourself is something you would learn in\\\\u00a0 counseling an effective treatment modality for this situation is cognitive behavioral therapy\",\"a lot of times the thoughts we have about ourselves are messages we have received from other people and later internalized them so in that sense these thoughts are yours and belong to you but you have received these messages from somebody else even though we all receive messages like this at times it pays to be careful not to ignore other messages we are receiving such as a loved one appreciating your help or attention a friend responding to encouragement or a colleague showing interest in you i hope this helps\",\"those kinds of thoughts can be quite difficult to handle but if they are your own thoughts and not voices you are hearing which can be very different they likely are not new to you from what ive learned from clients i work with often these thoughts have been quite useful for them over the course of their lives that through criticizing oneself it is a way of motivating oneself however in your case and in most of those clients it has caught up to them and its almost like they no longer need the motivation that they can do just fine motivating themselves by themselvesi think its important to see these thoughts as the voice of the inner critic that inner critic was there for a long time again because it i like to identify it as a thing inside of you thought that you needed motivation in the form of criticism to stay on task with your life but now that that kind of sentiment is no longer needed by you it might be time to have a different kind of relationship with it but it wants to be heard it doesnt want to silenced or stopped in your words so instead of trying to ignore it perhaps we can see all the ways you are worth something and internalize take in let those ways resonate with you sit with them think about them so that the inner critic can see that it isnt quite correct in what it is saying in essence you are instead sitting with the thoughts or worthiness instead of worthlessnessif that is challenging sometimes seeing someone who is objective such as a therapist can be helpful they can help you see the ways in which you are strong have resilience as well as any positive attributes that might be hard to see in the face of this loud inner critic and above all if you feel like this doesnt resonate for you and that the voices might actually be voices an evaluation should be sought to further tease out what sorts of symptoms you are experiencing\",\"we have thousands of thoughts a day some thoughts we choose to think and some thoughts are random as you describe we cant control the first random thought but as soon as we become aware of it we can make a conscious choice to change the thought positive affirmations are messages we intentionally read to or tell ourselves to help us counteract negative thoughts if you find yourself under stress on some days more than others you may notice an increase of these negative thoughts about yourself\\\\u00a0 to help you neutralize your

moving on from relationships even if the person showed them a sort of love that theyve never felt theyve had or deserved before sometimes even just the fact that this has happened for them can eventually see below lead them to seek out love again because they now believe they will be able to have that againso the notsogood news though is that one can not just move on id even venture to say that the pressure you may be putting on yourself to just move on and out of this yucky hole of feelings that you are in is actually too much pressure and adding to the yucky feelings as they are instead try thinking of getting past these feelings as grieving over the loss of someone even though someone didnt die there is still a significant loss you are experiencing and therefore how essential it is to allow yourself to grieve to feel whatever feelings of anger or sadness or something else that you are feeling often it is really helpful to speak those feelings i recommend professionals in this case who can help you feel like you are not pathological for this struggle and instead that it is completely normal love is a crazy thing and the feelings can get very confusing but the last stage of grieving is acceptance and it is very challenging to get there if you skip over denial anger bargaining and depression\",\"what if we think about this in metaphor imagine a dirt road suddenly paved over  where before it was small once paved it was faster smoother and suddenly you the driver knew what real driving could feel like then your road got a pothole now every time you drive you hit that hole and it only seems to get worse the more you drive over it \\\\u00a0until that hole is patched  until you choose to fill your heart with either love for another or love for yourself  you might find it challenging to keep driving on your road instead of letting go of how you felt try to hang on to that feeling just direct it inwards youve shared youre capable of feeling strongly for another surely youre worthy of that same regard all the best\",\"there is no wrong or right way to define a relationship i believe each relationship we are in is an opportunity to expand

language is quality time youre not hitting that bulls eye because youre not home the five languages are words quality time acts of service gifts and touch i recommend couples grab this book sit down and figure out what their love languages are and thenslowlyyou start to ask for the kind of love you want and you start to speak your partners language a bit better you may never be fluent but you can

doesnt know what their values are then its difficult to do anything and right now everyday we hear uncertainty in what used to be our basic assumptionsyoure more normal for noticing and feeling

simplifying stress is a key to minimizing stress and leads to feeling less stressed out\",\"there are many causes for feeling stressed out between a demanding job family responsibilities and everything else that can come up stress becomes more and more part of our everyday life one of the best ways to combat the toxic effects of stress on our bodies social lives and overall well being is to engage in selfcare but not the selfcare that most people think of like vacations or massages the best selfcare is the kind that helps you live the life that you already have rather than escape it you see the reason why vacations and massages dont work long term in reducing stress is that they allow you to escape from what is causing the stress without truly fixing it so you just return to what already stressed you out so instead you need to find ways to help live with the stressors that you already have they can be things like creating a more manageable schedule introducing healthy eating or exercising financial planning and even learning a few simple relaxation skills the key to combatting stress is to make small but consistent changes to your life so that it becomes more manageable

find really effective is to try to do the opposite of that which sends the signal to our mind that we are relaxed so that means taking slower fuller breaths and trying to relax any areas where we might be gripping our muscles check out meditation apps such as breathe which can talk you through a relaxing breath exercise i recommend using the app daily whether you feel stressed or not and then also using it when you re feeling particular moments of stress  that way you are practicing the skill when you feel calmwish and itll be ready and able to help you when stress hits hard\",\"learn how

first time being in therapy is scary but youll soon know if you are a good match\",\"people do cry in therapy sometimes but its not at all necessary to cry in order for most kinds of therapy to be helpful when you start counseling you dont yet know your counselor very well so its normal to keep your feelings in check until you feel comfortable and a bit more relaxed with your counselor and with the situation sometimes though there are emotions that have been waiting and waiting to finally find someone who will listen with a kind ear if you feel safe right away in the situation with your counselor you might just cry in spite of your fears about it your therapist is used to people expressing how they feel and will keep strict confidentiality so even though its embarrassing finally experiencing someone truly listening with empathy and kindness may just be worth it its okay too to let your counselor know right at the beginning that youre kind of freaked out about getting too emotional in front of another person\",\"crying is a natural process when you talk about upsetting things especially in therapy when you are opening up and being so vulnerable i suggest that you consider how you would feelrespond to someone that was confiding to you and they began to cry if you felt concerned supportive and empathetic then you know exactly how us therapists feel when our clients are emotional in sessions i suggest that you think of times where you have cried and how you felt at that time in public and what would have helped to make you feel less uncomfortable during your tears\\\\u00a0i think of crying like any other natural reaction of our body such as sneezing laughing coughing you cant help but do those things and most people wont really judge negatively if you do it in public similarly crying is our bodys reaction when we are emotional whether it is tears of joy from a hilarious joke or from being upset\\\\u00a0if you are very uncomfortable about crying but willing to start therapy perhaps you can ask the therapist if you can turn your chair around if you begin crying this way you are not facing them and can self soothe without worrying about how you physically look at that timei wish you luck and you should be proud of yourself for starting therapy and i wish you a wonderful journey on this important path that you are embarking on\",\"it is not uncommon to be a bit nervous meeting your therapist or another person for the first time your therapist understands that calling and getting an appointment was a big step for you and will do their best to put you at ease providing a safe environment for our clients includes not judging them and being comfortable with the information and emotions that they share with us it is ok to cry and to trust that the therapist will honor this as part of your process\",\"yes if crying is how you are expressing an emotion then not only would it be normal but hopefully encouraged because its an important part of therapy to have a safe space to express your emotions we might encourage you to put words to the tears as well to help you expand on your experience and begin to make more sense of itas a therapist our job is help you open up and feel comfortable enough doing so i sincerely hope no therapist would ever shame you for whatever experience you are having in the room\",\"it is is absolutely normal to cry in therapy i can understand wanting to keep everything together and put your best foot forward with everyone you come into contact with but it can be such a powerful experience to cry with somebody that can hear you and accept you its so brave of you to go and share yourself with your counselor i hope you will keep being brave as you begin healing\",\"when talking about difficult issues it is very normal to cry crying is a natural way for us to cope with the sadness that we experience in life when confronting some of these things in a counseling session tears

been stuffing down \\\\u00a0 crying is \\\\u00a0often a sign that you are really working things through and getting in touch with feelings that you need to get in touch with in order to heal so  to

hours but he hasnt called me back i called him on the weekend and made it clear that i want him to call me back can he just ignore me\",\"Response\":[\"mental health providers should promptly return calls from current clients as well as from potential clients\\\\u00a0 this is even true if the social worker or counselor is unable to make an appointment with the caller\\\\u00a0 in that case the social worker should call you back to let you know that he is unable to schedule an appointment with youin addition mental health providers have an obligation to follow through with their own communication standards\\\\u00a0 for example if the social worker in this case has an outgoing voicemail message that promises returned calls within 24 hours he has an obligation to follow through on that promiseall that being said it is also worth remembering that mental health professionals are just people too it is possible that he had an unforeseen emergency that kept him from from returning your call promptlyin the end i agree with sherrys advice if you feel this social worker is not a good fit for you you probably should trust your gut and find someone else who is a better fit\",\"yes your former social worker should return your phone callit is the professional ethic to do so and plain human decency to do soif he doesnt there is nothing you can directly do about the fact of his ignoring youthere are formal complaints you can make which you can consider doingwhat matters most is receiving social work servicestick with looking for another social worker who is willing to help

recommend that you talk with a local mental health professionalremember just because it was the best decision of your life that doesnt mean that what happened to you or in your presence automatically leaves you when you leave the relationship our brain is actually hardwired to remember things that have caused us pain or great emotional distress as a way of protecting us from them happening again

yourself i agree with you that ending your former relationship was a very wise decisionthe nightmares and flashbacks show that you were deeply affected emotionally and on the foundations of your basic naturethe way for these to stop is by the slow process of realizing how badly injured and frightened you were of your former partneronce youve stabilized yourself by accepting the tremendous harshness that was part of the former relationship then the nightmares and flashbacks will disappear gradually usually maybe all at oncethere is a possibility too that your former relationship connected with being emotionally ignored abandoned treated harshly during your time of growing up yearssince generally people choose partners who relate similarly to the ways in which they felt treated by parents it is possible that you had been badly treated while growing up and werent aware of this until going through this terrible relationshipcongratulations on ending your relationship\",\"your challenge is

that you can try  for example identify the warning signs for becoming irritated and plan a response such as taking a deep breath informing the person you are becoming irritated and need some space or find a distraction temporarily like listening to music or going for a walk since you are aware of blaming others for things not working out you can proactively make a personal commitment to taking

is approachable meaning someone you could talk to because they express confidence in you let them know you are nervous about doing a good job also let them know how you learn new tasks information or

you could be anxious because you are forgetting things or you could be forgetting things because you are anxious when you are having anxiety certain parts of your brain are overactive because you are in a kind of protective mode its also possible that forgetting things and anxiety are not relatedsomething else to try would be to notice where you feel your anxiety in your body and put your hand there is a way of giving yourself comfortanother thing about anxiety is that having anxiety can lead to more worry about having more anxiety one thing that helps for some people is to go to the regular primary care doctor to make sure that there are no physical problems just for the regular physical so they know that there are no physical problems and that the anxiety will lessen in a few minutesalso if you are able to notice your feet on the floor or your hips in the chair this is helping you to be mindful of your body and connecting you to your surroundings during this in combination

experiencing depression may benefit from medication often to lift the heaviness of the illness enough so that one can focus on psychotherapy and therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy and

things dont get you to where you would like to go consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couplesremember that you can only guarantee change in yourself you can ask him to make changes but you cant control whether he does or not you can control your reactions and what you do about your own thoughts feelings and actions in the relationshipif youre going to talk about something important or you really want him to listen first ask whether this is a good timetry to talk to him without blaming fingerpointing or asking him to change this can be difficult but it also opens a lot of doors for effective discussionsbe mindful of your packaging by that i mean that you may have a very important message that youre trying to get across if you able to say it in a way that is clear and wrapped in such a way that he can hear what youre actually saying that is helpful if you are talking in ways that are angry or as i sometimes say wrapped in spikes that can be difficult to hear and receive rather than hearing what youre actually trying to get across he may just hear the fact that you are angryif your husband is able to listen to you andor restate what you are saying and get it right or close to right let him know what that feels like to you and how important it isif youre asking questions try to avoid why question and use what makes how when where who instead questions starting with why can not only be difficult to answer but can also trigger a lot of emotions that some people are not ready to deal with right awayalso keep in mind that listening and being able to reflect what you are saying does not imply agreement this may be something that would be good to discuss with your husband  just because he is hearing what youre saying doesnt mean that hes agreeing with youlastly but importantly some people really dont know how to listen effectively there are people who just are not taught to do that until much later in their lives sometimes listening to someone can actually be very vulnerabilityproducing it may be helpful to ask your husband if he knows what makes him struggle with being able to listen if you notice that hes really struggling\",\"unfortunately you cant directly change another persons behavior however you can give him feedback on how his not listening impacts you the best way to provide feedback is in 3 parts the first part is telling him the emotion you are experiencing when he doesnt listen such as hurt sad and unloved i would stay away from feelings such as frustrated angry and irritated and use a more vulnerable emotion the second part is what he does specifically to make you feel that way be specific example when i get home and tell you about my day and you dont look away from the tv be objective as possible when you describe his behavior and the last part is the most important tell him what you want him to do and again be specific example i would rather you turn off the tv give me eye contact and reassure me about my day here is an example with all 3 parts together i feel hurt when you dont say anything to me when i tell you about my fight with my friend i want you to hug me and tell me you understand how i feel hope that

that actually what they said or is this just what you heard sometimes because of our own selfdoubts and fears we skew and misinterpret the messages we receive from others again listen to the message

are regarding the amount of energy and time youre spending on being good enough explore with them how you feel your already giving your bestif the person is unwilling to work at understanding this

they feel the need to constantly put others down to make themselves feel better if youre in the direct path of this individual then it serves to reason you will probably be in the direct fire as well explore whether or not you want this relationship to continue in your life if its a relationship that must continue then work on what you will do to distance yourself from their toxicity or their

statement or phrase you can repeat to yourself anytime you start to feel that sense of stress and pressure from striving for perfection the mantra can remind you to let go of this expectation you have for yourself or that others have for you so you can also let go of the stress and anxiety surrounding the expectation\\\\u00a0i leave you with one of my favorite quotes that perhaps you can use as your mantra no one can make you feel inferior without your consent   eleanor roosevelt\",\"the feeling of never feeling good enough usually stems from our early relationship with our\\\\u00a0parents

to go i feel very emotionally drained how can i deal with this\",\"Response\":[\"all you can docontrol is work on yourself when you have enough sense of self you will know how to deal with your family therapy is an investment in yourself which affects your family\",\"hello i am sorry to hear about you feeling verbally abused trapped without an escape and emotionally drained sounds to me like you are being treated more like a child than an adult \\\\u00a0its time to learn about healthy boundaries and being treated like an adult this process will take time but beyond elevating your selfesteem and worth you will be modeling to your children a healthy adult model to them an empowered confident and person that is worthy of respect\\\\u00a0please invest in yourself find yourself a therapist that encourages and empowers you to have a voice and not feel invisible youll be so glad you did\",\"i am so sorry this is happening to you\\\\u00a0 one thought i have is for you to create a mantra or a soothing statement to say over and over to yourself as you are being bombarded with this negativity and abuse\\\\u00a0 for example you could say living here is temporarily one day i will have my own place\\\\u00a0 or you could say something like i am a good person i am a good parent and i always try to do the best i can\\\\u00a0 saying this over and over to yourself as you are listening to your parents will help you to tune out some of their words but it will also start to build more positive neural connections and start to wire your brain to build andor strengthen your self esteem\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0focus on the temporary nature of your situation start making plans for leaving the situation\\\\u00a0 if you are under 18 and cant leave because you are in school now is a good time to start planning for when you can leave\\\\u00a0 that when when the opportunity is available you know how you will get a job how you will find an apartment who will provide daycare\\\\u00a0 \\\\u00a0this will make the transition out of your parents home much easier and it will give you something to look forward to while you are in their home\\\\u00a0 take care\",\"your situation is a difficult one but i would encourage you to start considering how to set boundaries for yourself and your family members often times we believe we have to allow a certain behavior because a person is family this is not true it sounds like you could use some help understanding finding your voice and asserting yourself with your family members\",\"i am so sorry you are experiencing this situation \\\\u00a0considering that you mentioned not having a place to go it may be best to address the problem as oppose to just take all of it confrontation can be done in a healthy and effective way \\\\u00a0being able to communicate your feelings with the intent of improving the problem can be a great skill needed in multiple settings in life \\\\u00a0the therapy process can help build this skill set and goal plan to remove yourself from the home \\\\u00a0good luck\",\"the first step is realizing your value and establishing firm boundaries when your parents cross that boundary and are verbally abusive you have to have a plan to stand your ground and act upon it that plan may include a better job to afford a place of your own a domestic violence shelter if you are unable to provide for your needs a firm talk with your parents about your parental authority or other whatever you do has to be firm or consistent a boundary that you allow someone to cross is no boundary there is always a way if you have no where to go ask yourself why is that the casewhich i am sure you have considered already and what can i do about it if you choose not to take any action then you are enabling your parents to remain abusive ask yourself too why am i not acting on my situation am i too dependent on them do i not want to change is it easier just to let them provide for me be honest with yourself you need to work on your self esteem and things that empower you support groups in person or online church groups or organizations friends books music etc but think on things that will empower you are you stuck financially because of the need for a job do you need to go back to school do you need training in a new field there are a myriad of possibilities and answers action think action and change what can i change\",\"i cant imagine what you are feeling but i can tell you that you are right to be concerned about your children baring witness to this abuse \\\\u00a0this is a great teachable moment for your kids \\\\u00a0how you handle yourself will be very important for your children to see \\\\u00a0your reaction is what you should focus on \\\\u00a0will you react with rage and name calling will you listen to your parents with respect and talk to them in private about how they are speaking to you in front of your kids \\\\u00a0will you talk your kids about what is going\\\\u00a0from reading this i am assuming you live with your parents \\\\u00a0if this is the case you have to think about what you can do to change your situation \\\\u00a0have a plan set a goal \\\\u00a0dont lose hope\",\"i think one of the best things to pass on to our children or simply one of the best lessons in life is to learn when to internalize its an issue in me and when to externalize its an issue in them as well as always finding the balance of the twoin this case you dont seem to be the issue sure living with your parents with your child probably is not your dream scenario nor your parents but there are ways to process that without someone feeling abused and your parents clearly have zero ability or boundaries if they are willing to verbally abuse you in front of your child and their grandchild if there is a reason they are doing so im sure they think they have a good one however the dynamic that they are willingly setting up is problematic and it is their problem\\\\u00a0however by being strong and not taking in someones verbal abuse you are going to role model for your child how its about what is inside of you your own drive that will be what is important not what others say about you its important to always come back to yourself inside and seeing the good that is in you or even just noticing that its there if you cant quite see it in its entiretyi would also advise your parents to think about their own role modeling\",\"when their verbal abuse starts tell them you are exiting the conversation because the way theyre talking to you is unacceptableexplain you are willing to hear their point of view only not when it is expressed as abusethey may not agree with your opinion and also may not want to changeeven if they do not change you are entitled to be treated as a human being who is worthy of respectexplain your reason to exit the conversation and ask them to write down their requests for you to consider\"]}\\n{\"Context\":\"im

and what to do about itconsider yourself a person who wants to find a better way to be who you are and this will get you further with better results than to read a list of descriptions which all are very indicting and negative sounding\",\"hello and thank you for your question selfdiagnosing is something that we all do about one health issue or another taking a guess about what may or may not be happening to us is completely normal however the actual clinical diagnoses of a mental health disorder requires a licensed mental health professional here are a few reasons for this 1 making a clinical diagnosis often requires other things besides\\\\u00a0matching up\\\\u00a0the symptoms of a disorder to come to a diagnoses for any of the things you mentioned a counselor\\\\u00a0would consult the\\\\u00a0dsm but they\\\\u00a0may also\\\\u00a0use some type of screening tool assessment or scale many disorders have similarities and it requires someone with training to tease out the differences in the symptoms 2 our judgement is sometimes off when it comes to assessing ourselves we really cant be objective something as serious as determining a diagnosis really needs to be done by someone who has that objectivity in addition once you know your diagnosis treating it usually requires help from a professional 3 sometimes the symptoms of a mental health disorder makes selfdiagnoses impossible in and of itself for example someone could be having hallucinations or delusions and not realize it that would clearly make it impossible for them to diagnose themselves there a many examples where something like this could happen with different mental health disorders there are other reasons but these are\\\\u00a0three important ones now does this mean that you are wrong about your diagnosis maybe not you may be correct but\\\\u00a0it is important to get this confirmed by a professional mental health clinician if a disorder is then found you can begin to talk about

that allow you to manage difficult thoughts and feelings differently so they dont have the same impact on you that they do right now for some people they actually do begin to experience less hurtful thoughts once they learn how to manage the ones they have differently acceptance and commitment therapy may be a good choice for you\\\\u00a0there is information online and even selfhelp books that

like there is a very critical aspect of your self that is alive and taking over \\\\u00a0sometimes when we are stuck it is because a part of ourselves a way that perhaps we learned to cope with difficult situations earlier in our lives has decided to run the show \\\\u00a0like a highly critical part that may actually be desperately attempting to protect us from a past hurt\\\\u00a0slowing down and even forming a relationship with this critical internal part will help you get some space from it \\\\u00a0when we can begin to observe parts of ourselves be curious about them get to know them like a new friend then we have room for other ways of being \\\\u00a0beginning therapy could be a great way to change this feeling of worthlessness \\\\u00a0beginning to build a better relationship and understanding of yourself will deeply influence the relationships around you \\\\u00a0this first step may feel hard to reach out to someone and it could be the beginning step to a path of radically shifting your relationship with yourself and others in your life\",\"feelings of worthlessness often originate \\\\u00a0from what you learned about yourself when you were young improving your self esteem needs focus on that original message from parents teachers or siblings that may be suppressed \\\\u00a0most of us need help to uncover the lie because you were born valuable\",\"the feeling of being worthless is caused by your inside being not matching your outside result your comparison to others and you thinking you need to be someone other than who you are you are not worthless no one is worthless you need to find your worth and not let yourself talk yourself out of the good you find in yourself i hope these words resonate with you and that you start looking for your worth even if its as simple as i am able to get out of bed and call someone and make a joke\",\"hi there im sorry youre feeling this way let me see if i can guide you in the right direction often when i talk to my clients about feelings of worthlessness we start with a little bit of selfexploration we start with noticing start to notice when these feelings come up for you is there a particular time\\\\nof day a specific person who brings it out a phrase you hear just\\\\nstart to notice usually its tied to something but it may take a while to figure out what that somethingsomeone is try to be patientnext we start to explore when did these feelings start where do you think they come from is there something  a statement  perhaps that repeats in your head over and over again if so whose voice is it these are difficult questions and just a few of them so take your time answering them we usually do it over a few sessions it might even be helpful to write them down somewhere if you have a journal that would be a great place as research has shown that our brain works differently when we put pen to paper versus typing on a computer now comes the good news our brains are able to rewire themselves this allows us to change habits we dont want as well as statements we say to ourselves that are no longer serving us the next step is to select an ally someone who is or has been in your corner someone who is always rooting for you if you dont have someone like that thats ok  a lot of us dont  you can just make someone up close your eyes and try to describe that person in great detail from the way they look to the way they act to the way they sound now pick a phrase you would like that person to say to you whenever you start to think that youre worthless something that will help you feel better about yourself  a characteristic a skill a great joke you tell a physical attribute this also takes time and may involve you asking for help from someone who knows youonce you have all of that together  the noticing answers from where these feelings and statements come from your ally your new statement you can try to put it altogether when the feelings come up notice what is bringing them up and then call upon your ally to try to change the statement in your head from the selfdefeating one to the more positive uplifting one i hope this was helpful again i do this with my clients over quite a few weeks if not months and i am there with them the whole time it is quite an involved process and can bring up a lot of very difficult feelingmemories if at any point you find it too hard to go at alone please seek help if you take anything away from this reply know that there is help out there and that it is possible to change the way you feel\",\"i am sorry you are feeling this way \\\\u00a0we all have narratives that we say to ourselves whether it is valid or not \\\\u00a0in your case it would be beneficial to explore when and how this belief began and rewrite your story \\\\u00a0there are different ways to explore and rewrite \\\\u00a0this process requires commitment selfreflection and courage\"]}\\n{\"Context\":\"im having relationship

an essential piece in being a better communicator being an effective communicator will almost always improve the quality of your relationships\\\\u00a0what stands in your way of listening to her do you find yourself becoming defensive when she brings up issues do you often find yourself thinking of what you want to say next do you take her words personally preventing you from having the ability to problem solvehere are some tips that may help you with being a better listener1 concentrate on what you are hearing not on what you will say next2 ask questions if you need clarification or dont understand3 summarize what youre hearing after every couple of minutes to make sure that youre not missing anything4 ask your partner what she needs from you is she expecting advice or does she simply need to vent5 keep eye contact and avoid using nonverbal cues that demonstrate defensiveness or irritation such as eye rolling or crossing your arms6 remember that its okay to disagree and if this is the case then decide as a team how you want to move forwardi hope this helps good luck to you\",\"the best tool for becoming a better listener that i know of is called imago dialogue it consists of 3 steps1 mirroring what she says without judging commenting refuting defending arguing or scoffingjust listening no matter the content and repeating it back wordforword continue to ask if she has more to add until she doesnt2 validating you tell her you you understanding why she feels this way if you dont understand then find a way you can also say that makes sense or i hear you or i get that3 empathizing tell her how you think she must feel about what shes telling you your job is to try and feel what it feels like to be herthis is a very different way of communicating than were used to my guess is that the arguments discussions and debates youve had with her have been counterproductive because youre both trying to win with imago dialogue you both win she gets to be heard and you get to

first step for making this sort of change is being motivated to change and it sounds like you have that so you are already on the right trackas far as learning how to listen try some of these stepsask whether a certain time is a good time for your girlfriend to have an important conversationif she has a subject that she would like to discuss consider listening to her as an investigative reporter and asking questions that help you to gain more understanding of her experience these questions usually begin with words like who what where when questions starting with the word why can sometimes make people very uncomfortable because they may not explicitly know why they are asking for something or feeling a certain way you can try communicating this way for just five minutes or so on until you feel as though you can restate what your girlfriend is saying and have her agree that you are recapturing the essence of what she is trying to communicatethen you can switch so she is listening to you trying to understand your experience you could also start by talking about something that is important to youremember that stating that you follow or hear something that she is saying doesnt mean that you agreealso try sticking to one subject at a time its difficult to really understand one topic if you are on to the next within just a minute or twotry to use the word want or wish instead of need saying that you need something or if your girlfriend would say that that is not a need for safety or something like that can make whatever you are asking for sound like an obligation that takes away from that whole motivation to change from inside the partner who is agreeing to change or try to changesomething else to try would be using some sort of timeout consider thisdiscuss the idea of using timeout before you actually need it and before the discussion starts timeout is a way to give each of you a way to calm down for five 10 15 minutes or maybe even an hour when there are a lot of emotions happening each person gets wrapped up in protecting themselves from the emotions they are feeling and can lose track of what is actually going on in the conversation as compared to what they are perceivingwhen using timeout say to your girlfriend or she can say to you i need an hour before we can go back to this then actually come back to the discussionsome people are very afraid to use this technique because in the past not talking about something right away meant that it never was returned to and was never resolved in any way this is why the agreement is important before you need itwhile it may be helpful to ask your girlfriend what it is she may want from you it is you that would be in charge of deciding whether you want to make that change and putting it into practicetry to remember that part of being in a couple is holding onto your own wants wishes and desires while recognizing those of your partneras one final idea consider spending about 15 minutes a week together where you are not problemsolving about anything just connecting with one anotheri encourage you to see a therapist who specializes in couples if you would like some more specific ideas for what is happening within each of you and between youbest wishes\",\"let go of your ego the ego tends to get in the way of things be a man and listen do not react so uch to life around you life is not out to

we often forget and give up on things that we always wanted to do or to try now its time to bring out that dusty bucket list and start trying something new\\\\u00a05 if possible change your scenery by going away on vacation with a friend or even by yourself changing your surroundings can really help you change your thoughts mindset\\\\u00a0and forget your ex even if just for a few hours even a

what can i do to get rid of this addiction\",\"Response\":[\"hi good for you in planning ahead to do whats healthiest for your baby and yourself thats a great first step its also good that you are able to identify that its not always a physical need thats driving the addictionfor the next steps i would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur the psychological or mental cravings are usually based out of habit such as having a cigarette after a meal and if youre consciously trying to quit youll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel etc etc well if im on a diet and i continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer eventually ill give in and eat ityoure going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette thats normal and for the most part out of your control but you choose whether or not to continue thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought thats what you would have to work on changing when you have that initial thought acknowledge it ok i kind of want a cigarette now but then change the thoughts that typically follow distract yourself think about something else do something else whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigaretteive suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what theyre going to do when the time comes write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it eventually it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have itbest of luck and you have a really great motivator to quit  your baby\",\"first off i would like to congratulate you on making the decision to stop smoking\\\\u00a0 the next thing i want to share is that there are so many different ways to kick the habit some people find solace in groups while others prefer to see a counselor about this individually remember that the crux of addiction is feeling one way and using a substance or thing to feel a different way\\\\u00a0 my suggestion is to find an addiction counselor and create an individualized plan together to help you stop smoking  your chances of stopping smoking are much higher when you have professional support and a plan to work on outside of your sessions\",\"while smoking can be incredibly difficult to quit doing its not impossible so the first thing to not lose is hope and certainly planning to have a baby can be exactly the catalyst that one needs to motivate to complete this sort of task but as i said it still wont be easy even with the motivation therethere is a definite physical component but its great that you can acknowledge the psychological addiction that exists it would be helpful to dive into what that psychological need actually is as it can vary from person to person whereas the physical addiction doesnt as much and therefor can be helped through gums and patches and inhalers etc exploring and getting to the root of the psychological need can help you to determine what is going on for you psychologically and how else you can meet those needs of yours perhaps in much healthier and more adaptive ways that also help you to feel really good about yourself while replacement is not always advocated having psychological needs is not something to be ashamed of but rather nurtured\",\"its very admirable that you are trying to stop smoking for the sake of your health and your childs health\\\\u00a0 the mental aspect of quitting a drug can and usually is the hardest part\\\\u00a0 first it can be helpful to change the focus of your thinking so you are focusing on the healthy behaviors you will startimprove rather than only focusing on the behavior that you are trying to stop\\\\u00a0 the reason for this is that our brains hear the main topic of our thoughts\\\\u00a0 that is when you tell yourself quit smoking quit smoking quit smoking your brain hears smoking smoking smoking\\\\u00a0 so we need to put together a selfcare plan that addresses your thinking emotions and behaviors nutrition physical activity and other stress reducing activities\\\\u00a0 the idea is to have an effective plan in place to both prevent yourself from feeling intense stress which increases cravings and to have a wellplaced plan for when the intense cravings inevitably present themselves\\\\u00a0 and lastly and possibly the most important you have to believe you deserve to be the healthiest version of yourself\\\\u00a0 think about the times when you are most vulnerable to smoke stressful situations after meals when drinking social situations etc\\\\u00a0 the use of affirmations is also an important resource as what we say to ourselves effects our mood\\\\u00a0 repeatedly telling yourself i am healthy i am getting healthier my lungs are becoming clear and healthy or other affirmations like this\\\\u00a0 even if you dont believe them at first continue saying them\\\\u00a0 this step is important to improve cognitive flexibility which trains your brain to be open to change\\\\u00a0 think about activities that you like to do or that you would like to try and replace smoking with those activities\\\\u00a0 any activity that can make you laugh time with friends watching comedies etc will evoke a calming response because when we feel happy we typically dont feel stressed out simultaneously\",\"breaking any habit is no easy feat

this can involve how to communicate effectively with friends family and other loved ones or learning how to have selfacceptance i strongly recommend speaking with a licensed clinician one on one to help facilitate the change you are looking for\",\"hello and thank you for your question i am so glad that you reached out for help i know that the dysphoria can feel nearly impossible to handle especially since you have limited support from people who accept who you are you may already know some of these resources but i am going to share a few 1 the website wwwletsqueerthingsupcom is a blog from a very good writer that i know his name is sam dylan finch and he is transgender he writes about mental health transgender issues and many other topics i know he has frequently written about gender dysphoria and ways to manage it you may want to check out his site and do a search on there 2 the website wwweverydayfeminismcom employs many transgender writers and several have written about gender dysphoria and have given ideas for managing it if you search for gender dysphoria on their site many articles pop up it may be a good resource for you especially if you ever feel lonely and start to forget that there are others out there who are like you and have your back 3 i am not sure where you live but there are counselors who specialize in affirmative therapy which is what is recommended for folks who are part of the lgbtq community so if you decide to see a counselor about the dysphoria try to find one that specifically says they have been trained in the affirmative approach in addition feel free to ask questions of the counselor before agreeing to see them for counseling an ethical counselor would have no problem answering them before having you come in 4 if there are some lgbtq resource centers in your area try to reach out to them and see if there are support groups gaining more support from others would be helpful sometimes lgbtqfriendly counselors leave their contact information for people in resource centers 5 finally i know you have not mentioned being depressed or suicidal but i also know that it is very common for people to

gender dysphoria is getting really difficult to deal with on my own i need some strategies for dealing with it what should i do\",\"Response\":[\"hello and thank you for your question i am so glad that you reached out for help i know that the dysphoria can feel nearly impossible to handle especially since you have limited support from people who accept who you are you may already know some of these resources but i am going to share a few 1 the website wwwletsqueerthingsupcom is a blog from a very good writer that i know his name is sam dylan finch and he is transgender he writes about mental health transgender issues and many other topics i know he has frequently written about gender dysphoria and ways to manage it you may want to check out his site and do a search on there 2 the website wwweverydayfeminismcom employs many transgender writers and several have written about gender dysphoria and have given ideas for managing it if you search for gender dysphoria on their site many articles pop up it may be a good resource for you especially if you ever feel lonely and start to forget that there are others out there who are like you and have your back 3 i am not sure where you live but there are counselors who specialize in affirmative therapy which is what is recommended for folks who are part of the lgbtq community so if you decide to see a counselor about the dysphoria try to find one that specifically says they have been trained in the affirmative approach in addition feel free to ask questions of the counselor before agreeing to see them for counseling an ethical counselor would have no problem answering them before having you come in 4 if there are some lgbtq resource centers in your area try to reach out to them and see if there are support groups gaining more support from others would be helpful sometimes lgbtqfriendly counselors leave their contact information for people in resource centers 5 finally i know you have not mentioned being depressed or suicidal but i also know that it is very common for people to consider\\\\u00a0suicide when they are struggling with dysphoria dealing with transphobia etc if this ever happens to you

that you can look at the patterns of lying in the past as well as whether you have a way to discuss this with your husband in the way that you would feel comfortable feeling vulnerable with your own feelings and also listening to what his responses arethis is difficult because i imagine you have a react very quickly and strongly to things like this because of what has happened in the past between

about if you are both able to do so without blaming pointing fingers or asking the other person to change this would just be an exchange of information ideally this part of the competition would not be about you saying he did something wrong but just expressing how you felt when you heard about itit may be helpful to discuss these things with a therapist first so you have some coping skills for

very depressed how do i find someone to talk to\",\"Response\":[\"you have already taken the brave first step of making the decision to heal from it and find a professional that will help you do so there are lots of different options nowadays for therapists as you can see them online or in an office\\\\u00a0 my biggest tip for you is to use psychology today or counsel chat to find a therapist\\\\u00a0 enter in your zip code and you will find many different therapists you can talk to  be sure to find someone that you most resonate with and ask them any questions you may have many\\\\u00a0 times therapists will provide free consultations and this can be a great opportunity to see if you are a good fit\",\"the first step which youve taken is actually wanting to talk to someone its a great sign that you are seeking to reach out for help and there are therapists everywhere there are even therapists online so you dont have to be that close to them or their officethere are several sites that i refer people to to begin the process of looking for a therapist i usually have them start with psychologytodaycom once there there is a therapist directory you can narrow choices down by ages that they work with insurance they accept depression as an issue they focus in etc you can also narrow down by therapists modality but that can get complicated if you arent too familiar with the various theoretical approaches its important that you find someone that you feel understands your situation that might mean that they identify an issue you are having in their profile or on their professional website but you should try to meet a couple of different therapists if you arent quite sure it can be challenging that first session but your best note not the best therapist will help you feel comfortable or as comfortable as possible given therapy can be uncomfortable especially at first and understood from the getgoi have found that asking friends or family for names and recommendations is also a common way to find a therapist because it can come from a trusted referral source but remember that we are all different so what works for one might not always be a good fit and again it could take a couple of first sessions with different therapists to know if someone is a good fit sometimes it can take a few sessions and if there is no one around that can give a name or two then searching online is quite common and can yield positive resultsand try not to give up finding a therapist is not easy but finding a good one for you is extremely rewarding\",\"hireaching out here is a great start i recommend looking for somebody in your area that works with people experiencing depression after youve chosen somebody to try feel free to call them for a consultation a lot of counselors and therapists offer free consultations and remember that your counselor is working for you so make sure they are a good fit i hope this has been of some help\",\"hang in there feeling depressed sucks but talking with someone can really help  so its awesome that youre already trying to figure out how to find that person tons of good suggestions already but to add my two cents  you can find therapists in your area and read a little bit about them to find someone you like the sound of via this website and also via wwwpsychologytodaycom if you have health insurance your insurer might be able to make recommendations as to therapists covered by your plan or if you happen to be in school the school itself should be able to connect you with either their own counselor or a center that they recommend nearby finding someone can take a few calls or a bit of research so if you need some immediate support or find yourself having thoughts of hurting yourself you can also call the great folks who run the suicide crisis line\\\\u00a0httpssuicidepreventionlifelineorg  they are great in moments of crisis\",\"great that you realize talking with a

you this gives you the power to receive the messages that she is sending to youi would also wonder where you have learned that there wasnt much good out there for you and how you can stay present in the moment when you are with your girlfriend and see that she wants to be there with you perhaps you could look at what makes you feel emotionally safe and trusting with her and focus on that you

for a reason and its appropriate now to simply trust that to ask him for some patience and to focus on learning to manage the anxiety rather than questioning this decision to move in fear is getting in the way of you trusting yourself and your decision you can figure the anxiety piece out while living with your boyfriendwhen youre in a bit of a crisis is not the right time to make a major change

further address whether or not you are gaywhether or not and to what degree a person accepts their sexuality depends on dense factors such as the culture of your family the beliefs about gay people with which you were brought up and your own tolerance for being a unique individualexamining these factors whether inwardly by yourself in online blogs and sites or live with other people requires patience and effortthe more you are willing to commit to figuring out your own truth the greater is your chance of finding it\",\"hello coming to terms with the idea that you might be of a sexuality other than the one in which you were socially raised to be can be emotionally disturbing and quite unsettling it creates anxiety maybe even panic and leaves us feeling confused and uncertain about our own sense of identity it becomes important to first ask yourself how you feel when you are thinking of being intimate with guys or if you desire them to be intimate with you it is important to know what impact this has on you because it can determine your level of follow through and desire in pursuing sexual activity with someone of the same sex i am not going to pass judgment on you either way  even for having the thoughts i have worked with the lesbian gay bisexual transgender queer lgbtq community in various ways over the years many i speak to say they had to struggle to come to terms with this awareness about how they see themselves sexually maybe you are bisexual and dont have an exclusive attraction to the same sex you might consider doing some searches online for community support groups in your area to explore the feelings and issues around this topic talking to someone who you trust can be helpful too running from your feelings is not a good idea and others in a support group for sexuality issues might be able to relate to you and what youre going through right now this will offer you perspective as you think on how this plays out in your lifecounselors are typically well trained to provide clinical services to clients who are experiencing feelings and thoughts much like the ones you are having now i encourage you to consider reaching out for help you are not crazy or insane for thinking of working with a counselor nor of having feelings of same sex attraction if you decide you are indeed gay then know that you are not alone and never will be alone in that feeling there is a huge community of support for you additionally we all need help sometimes dealing with all sort of issues a counselor can work more in depth with you to examine the motivations behind the feelings and help you come to terms with them more directly i hope that you come to a place where you feel less alone and more secure with yourself as you examine this area of your life no matter what

just a crush but i dont know how to cope with it    how should i deal with this\",\"Response\":[\"i can only imagine how hard that must have been to hear on one hand most of us would say we want our partners to always be honest with us but on the other disclosures like this can lead to feelings of worry and inadequacy if were not careful so let me first of all say that it is very normal for human beings even very committed and happy partners to have moments where they notice an attraction for someone else quite honestly the brain cant help it it sees something good looking and it pays attention and when we pay attention to something good our brains send out neurochemicals associated with that happy thoughtand we get a rush of what your girlfriend is labeling a crush the difficulty here is deciphering whether she was just attempting to honor her commitment to you by sharing this feeling or if she is continuing to feed those feelings i would encourage you to thank her for being honest if you havent already and ask her to further describe the nature of these feelings and what shed like to do from here as weird as it is to say at the end of the day what helps the most is typically reassuring yourself that you will be okay not matter what that it is worth it to invest in your relationship and give it your all and if someday god forbid this woman chooses to walk away then she is not the one will it hurt of course but is it the end hell no there are 75 billion people on the planet and i firmly believe statistically speaking alone there are at least several hundred

natural to feel a little insecure and youre doing a great job by asking how to cope better first of all longdistance relationships are very hard is this situation likely to continue for a long period of time the old adage that absence makes the heart grow fonder simply isnt true it requires a lot of work to keep the fire burning are you guys talking to each other a lot visiting each other relatively often making common plans for those visits or your future together do you manage to have fun together despite the distance eg laugh on the phone have shared experiences such as watching a movie simultaneously at your different locations perhaps having phone sex all of the above are good ways to ensure that your bond stays strong and there will be less space left for interest in other people based on the fact that\\\\u00a0 your girlfriend told you about the crush t i would guess that she thinks its innocent enough  nothing too threatening try to talk to her about your feelings and brainstorm together ways you can increase your intimacy which will likely improve your sense of security in the relationship but also help her get over the crush good luck zofia\",\"long distance relationships are very difficult to maintain not just for the lack of communication but also because of the lack of intimacy that comes along with it even if you have spectacular communication while in a longdistance relationship it is difficult to maintain intimacy because you are lacking in the physical contact aspect of intimacy here we are not talking about sex but about the emotional connection that happens along with physical contact it is also hard to have shared experiences when the two of you are in separate places these are the challenges that you face but there are some ways to improve your odds\\\\u00a0the first thing to remember here is that dating is all about finding a person that you want to eventually dedicate your time resources and self to if either of you finds that the relationship is one that you are not necessarily committed to it is better to find out and have the opportunity to date others before a commitment is made the second thing to remember is that open communication is a good sign in a relationship that being said i do not believe that sharing details about your crushes is the best thing for a relationship instead i would recommend working on improving the relationship as best you can it is a wonderful thing when we can feel that we have given our best efforts on something especially something as important as the act of loving\\\\u00a0here are a couple things that you can do to improve even a longdistance relationship start by downloading the gottman card decks app here httpswwwgottmancomcouplesapps while on the phone or video chat try asking each other some of these questions so that you can build a deeper knowledge of one another some may seem silly but they help you know the other person more intimately it is also helpful to make sure that you are having regular communication with each other some situations make it very difficult to communicate but if at all possible daily communication via phone or video chat would be best even if it is just for 30 minutes a day really dedicate your time and attention to each other during those calls next it can be helpful to know each others love languages so you can show each other how much you really care take the assessment for the 5 love languages and talk about the results together you can find the assessment here httpwww5lovelanguagescomprofileattraction to other people is completely normal and involves biological processes intimacy on the other hand creates real connection and dedication to each other learn about each other spend time together and you will create intimacy\",\"thanks for writing in several things come to mindi dont know how you are communicating but there is a great deal of difference between communicating through videoconferencing compared to text message when discussing subjects like this being able to hear andor see each other will help you to be able to gauge a lot of the emotions connected to what is going onare you in a place where you can ask your girlfriend questions about this crush and actually listen to her answers if you can listen nondefensively and ask questions about what is actually going on kind of like an investigative reporter might you are likely to hear about her experience thoughts feelings etc so you can actually see what the crush is like for her and how you want to react to thatthen you could see if she is willing to listen to your questions and answer them for youanother tip find out when is a good time to have this conversation if you are talking to your girlfriend after she just worked a 10 hour shift and she is frustrated about that it is likely that the emotion will transfer to the conversation that you are having even though it doesnt have anything to do with thatfind a way to keep yourself grounded and centered during the conversation notice your feet on the floor or your hips in the chair mindfully play with an object or something like a paperclip or a pen doing this mindfully by being aware of your senses will help you to not feel so overwhelmed during the conversationafter you have more details communicate about what it is that you want or wish for it is often easier to hear and discuss as opposed to talking about something that you needremember that while anger is a very real emotion there is always something else under it be aware of what else could be there hurt disappointment betrayal fear etc\",\"often communication is the key within relationships when faced with our significant other telling us about a crush it can create or highlight feelings or thoughts that can promote feelings of insecurity talk to your partner about their crush and use the conversation to strengthen your bond\",\"no one can tell you how to deal with your own relationship even a therapist but you should absolutely give your girlfriend the respect of believing both of those statements she gives you development of feelings and it being a crush if that makes you feel a certain way mistrustful no difference in feelings then that is what is most important to understand when you understand exactly how you feel about hearing this news then we can know how you should deal with thisyou have every right to be in the relationship or to leave the relationship but if trust is broken first and foremost it needs repairing what that repair looks like varies but can

both been coping with this distance as well as you can there are a few scenarios that i think would have pretty radically different paths for your own mental health and i would like to explore them separately\\\\u00a0the first scenario is that she has this crush but still chooses you and wishes to stay with you keeping the value of her choice in mind and the bravery she has shown in admitting this crush handling her gently in that vulnerable place will pay off you may find it worthwhile to explain your feelings about it to share how it is hurting you to know of this and what she means to you explaining those feelings will help you to not act out in your with emotions to cover up by becoming angry or withdrawing acting in this way will help assure her of her choice in you and sharing these emotions and feeling supported by her may help you cope with thisthe other scenario is that she has a crush on this man and she is wanting to leave the relationship with you to have one with this other person as before it would be useful for you to share your feelings with someone it can be difficult to process through these emotions as they are intense and often overwhelming in this scenario it may be too difficult to share these feelings with your girlfriend but it is still important that you acknowledge this loss and allow the associated emotions to have its place grieving the end of this relationship could be a great source of personal growthi hope this has been of some help\"]}\\n{\"Context\":\"ive been in a relationship for over a year hes cheated and lied i heard hes

the medication try to track your levels of anxiety on a scale of 1 to 10 throughout the day so you can get a pattern of what is happening also consider writing down what is happening before you have

in\\\\u00a0therapy is totally appropriate and even necessary good luck\",\"i would be more concerned with how is this being addressed in therapy therapy can be a rewarding process however often times we do not pay much attention to the messages being sent to our bodies i believe in somatic therapy which deals with our mind  body connection i would think it may not be a question of normal or abnormal however if it is impacting you then you must pay attention to that it would be helpful to explore the feelings youre having \\\\u00a0with your therapist it may be something that needs

your therapist can work toward helping you have a different experience\\\\u00a0\",\"everyone has different experiences going to therapy being nervous can be a typical emotion one might feel emotions are our bodys way of telling us important information about ourselves i would suggest talking openly in your sessions about this that way you can process your thoughts and feelings with the guidance of your counselor there are probably underlining emotions fears or insecurities that are being stirred up during your therapy sessions your counselor might suggest individual counseling depending on

addressing the couple relationship\\\\u00a0\",\"hi there\\\\u00a0thank you for your question its absolutely ok to feel nervous going to therapy i have experienced anxiety going to see my own therapist there can be a few reasons why you might feel this way\\\\u00a0first it is always unnerving to see a person who is a stranger and to share intimate things with that stranger you mentioned it has only been a couple of sessions your anxiety might subside as you continue to see your therapist and grow more comfortable with himher\\\\u00a0another reason why you might feel particularly nervous is perhaps you are not comfortable sharing things as children we might have bad experiences opening up to others someone might bully or ridicule us and that experience can stay with us for a long time making it extra scary to share our intimate feelings and thoughts with others if this the case as you continue with your sessions and have positive interactions with your therapists this anxiety will subside with time and you will relearn that it is safe to share\\\\u00a0and the last thought why you might feel the shakes is perhaps you know that you need to talk about some past experiences or memories that are uncomfortable and difficult\\\\u00a0regardless of the reason it might help you to bring up your nervousness in your session and share how you feel with your therapist having an open dialogue about your anxiety with your therapist can help you resolve some of that anxiety and built greater trust with your therapist\\\\u00a0\",\"normal can be an insidious word to use because it can undermine your sense of worth \\\\u00a0it implies theres one particular way you should be behaving and can leave you feeling crappy and abnormal if youre not behaving according to that prescribed standard \\\\u00a0instead what id recommend is to pay attention to your emotional experiences when youre attending therapy \\\\u00a0explore your feelings and thoughts without judgement and try to reflect and understand whats going on thats causing you anxiety \\\\u00a0once you figure out the underlying meaning of the anxiety you can figure out a way to handle it and action steps to take to diminish it \\\\u00a0\",\"hello there\\\\u00a0 you ask about being nervous and shaky walking in to your therapy session and want to know if its normal \\\\u00a0 i realize there a few ways to look at this\\\\u00a0 i presume you werent\\\\u00a0anticipating feeling this way and probably hoped to feel the opposite\\\\u00a0 well my initial response is yes sure it can be within reason to feel this way\\\\u00a0 have you been in therapy before is this somewhat new that could be part of the reason but either way new or not i think when are entering into a meeting that holds potential evaluation of deep things about you and your heart and soul it can cause anyone to tremble the soul can be anticipating some things could be shaken up here and it can feel scary to look at these things and then change\\\\u00a0 looking deep at our life can feel daunting and scary so your response just might be regards to potential growth trying to happen\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0 or is there something about the therapist you dont feel confident about\\\\u00a0 this too might be in play as a reason for your feelings\\\\u00a0 maybe you lack confidence in that therapist \\\\u00a0 have you let your therapist know

friend they are there to push the buttons that you might not want pushed and help you heal \\\\u00a0that in itself is scary and can make you anxious\\\\u00a0third you really never know where this therapy thing will go yes there are goals but sometimes side roads need to be taken and sometimes that is scaryknow this you are in the right place you are taking steps to change\\\\u00a0\",\"hello first i am so sorry you are experiencing these feelings they can be intense i will do my best to offer some suggestions or thoughts that i hope will be helpful to you there could be a number of things occurring therapy is a delicate private decision and i would first like to commend you for the fact that you are not giving up that you are working to figure this out and make this work it sounds like you are engaged and motivated to receive support from a professional\\\\u00a0your continued \\\\u00a0dedication and motivation will take you far i would first start by asking if you have discussed this with your therapist if you feel comfortable enough telling your therapist what is going on maybe inform the therapist that \\\\u00a0that you feel nervous and shaky i am a firm believer in open communication between the client and therapist as this builds a healthy therapeutic relationship that yields positive outcomes if this can be obtained and well received this is\\\\u00a0your time for healing and therapy should be a safe supportive environment to not only process but to seek support and guidance from a professional who can help you move past the barriers if you feel you are comfortable and able to speak to your therapist that would be my first suggestion is to tell he or she how you are feeling if they know then they can help determine the potential cause and allow you to process and move forward if this is left un resolved it will be hard for you to move forward if you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist i understand this is difficult if i may offer one more suggestion breathing exercises are very beneficial remind yourself what you are working to achieve close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips

like this\",\"Response\":[\"hello first i am so sorry you are experiencing these feelings they can be intense i will do my best to offer some suggestions or thoughts that i hope will be helpful to you there could be a number of things occurring therapy is a delicate private decision and i would first like to commend you for the fact that you are not giving up that you are working to figure this out and make this work it sounds like you are engaged and motivated to receive support from a professional\\\\u00a0your continued \\\\u00a0dedication and motivation will take you far i would first start by asking if you have discussed this with your therapist if you feel comfortable enough telling your therapist what is going on maybe inform the therapist that \\\\u00a0that you feel nervous and shaky i am a firm believer in open communication between the client and therapist as this builds a healthy therapeutic relationship that yields positive outcomes if this can be obtained and well received this is\\\\u00a0your time for healing and therapy should be a safe supportive environment to not only process but to seek support and guidance from a professional who can help you move past the barriers if you feel you are comfortable and able to speak to your therapist that would be my first suggestion is to tell he or she how you are feeling if they know then they can help determine the potential cause and allow you to process and move forward if this is left un resolved it will be hard for you to move forward if you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist i understand this is difficult if i may offer one more suggestion breathing exercises are very beneficial remind yourself what you are working to achieve close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with

sense and i encourage you to give it a bit more time and to talk to your therapist about how you are feeling\",\"hi there\\\\u00a0thank you for your question its absolutely ok to feel nervous going to therapy i have experienced anxiety going to see my own therapist there can be a few reasons why you might feel this way\\\\u00a0first it is always unnerving to see a person who is a stranger and to share intimate things with that stranger you mentioned it has only been a couple of sessions your anxiety might subside as you continue to see your therapist and grow more comfortable with himher\\\\u00a0another reason why you might feel particularly nervous is perhaps you are not comfortable sharing things as children we might have bad experiences opening up to others someone might bully or ridicule us and that experience can stay with us for a long time making it extra scary to share our intimate feelings and thoughts with others if this the case as you continue with your sessions and have positive interactions with your therapists this anxiety will subside with time and you will relearn that it is safe to share\\\\u00a0and the last thought why you might feel the shakes is perhaps you know that you need to talk about some past experiences or memories that are uncomfortable and difficult\\\\u00a0regardless of the reason it might help you to bring up your nervousness in your session and share how you feel with your therapist having an open dialogue about your anxiety with your therapist can help you resolve some of that anxiety and built greater trust with your therapist\",\"thank you for your question its completely normal and natural to feel nervous before a therapy session many people report having felt this way\\\\u00a0i cant say enough regarding the amount of courage it takes to reach out and attend a therapy session for many people it can take weeks months or even years of contemplating whether to see a therapist or not before actually contacting one and attending the first session it takes courage to want to work through any struggles you may be having or personal growth you aspire toward\\\\u00a0in your question you mentioned that youve gone several times and are still feeling nervous and shaky if you feel comfortable with your therapist and its a good fit for you i would suggest talking about this with your therapist you dont have to struggle each time you have your appointment together you and your therapist can work toward helping you have a different experience\",\"sure why notits nervewracking to go to a man or woman youve never met before and who is a total stranger that you are paying to take an interest in your life\\\\u00a0 youre likely feeling an internal truth about the sessions the man or woman with you and the man or woman sitting across from you\\\\u00a0 id listen to those feelingswouldnt it not be best to go to those around you that do provide comfort and aid first\\\\u00a0 wouldnt it be better to attend to those of faith around you who have love to offer first\\\\u00a0 wouldnt it be better to go to your family and loved ones first might try that see if your nervousness evaporates\",\"what you are experiencing is extremely normal opening up to someone you dont know from a can of paint can elicit some uncomfortable feelings and make you feel shaky with time and building trust with your therapist you will eventually start feeling less apprehensive before sessions consider bringing this up to your therapist as you both can process this experience together and figure out ways of coping with this anxiety before you come into the therapy room\",\"its very normal to be nervous going into therapy you are being vulnerable and honest which is always scary no matter how many times you do it the best part about therapy is that the more you go the more confident you are in your ability to work through those difficult feelings and while you still may sometimes get nervous you will have confidence too\",\"it depends on your definition of normal i would say that the average client i see feels some level of nervous energy when they come into their sessions and especially at the beginning i think that with clients who i work with that have difficult times in relationships maybe being able to trust people is tougher for them given their life experiences the expectation would be that they have a harder time moving through those nerves and feeling more at peace in sessionsin my opinion a competent therapist could help you explore where these nerves are actually coming from talking about yourself relating to another something else i encourage all of my clients to bring up whatever emotions are coming up for them in the moment as its helpful to the client to recognize the present moment emotion and then being able to process learn from and move through to a more peaceful place if that is what is being sought\",\"therapy can feel very weird to begin with  think about it how often do we go and tell a relative stranger our deepest darkest thoughts in the rest of our life so i think its reasonable to expect a certain level of

response is yes sure it can be within reason to feel this way\\\\u00a0 have you been in therapy before is this somewhat new that could be part of the reason but either way new or not i think when are entering into a meeting that holds potential evaluation of deep things about you and your heart and soul it can cause anyone to tremble the soul can be anticipating some things could be shaken up here and it can feel scary to look at these things and then change\\\\u00a0 looking deep at our life can feel daunting and scary so your response just might be regards to potential growth trying to happen\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0 or is there something about the therapist you dont feel confident about\\\\u00a0 this too might be in play as a reason for your feelings\\\\u00a0 maybe you lack confidence in

you should be behaving and can leave you feeling crappy and abnormal if youre not behaving according to that prescribed standard \\\\u00a0instead what id recommend is to pay attention to your emotional experiences when youre attending therapy \\\\u00a0explore your feelings and thoughts without judgement and try to reflect and understand whats going on thats causing you anxiety \\\\u00a0once you figure out the underlying meaning of the anxiety you can figure out a way to handle it and action steps to take to diminish it\",\"everyone has different experiences going to therapy being nervous can be a typical emotion one might feel emotions are our bodys way of telling us important information about ourselves i would suggest talking openly in your sessions about this that way you can process your thoughts and feelings with the guidance of your counselor there are probably underlining emotions fears or insecurities that are being stirred up during your therapy sessions your counselor might suggest individual counseling depending on what you learn about your anxiety in individual therapy you would have time to deal with your own stressors as you address your issues then you will have tools and skills that will be useful in addressing the couple relationship\",\"i would be more concerned with how is this being addressed in therapy therapy can be a rewarding process however often times we do not pay much attention to the messages being sent to our bodies i believe in somatic therapy which deals with our mind  body connection i would think it may not be a question of normal or abnormal however if it is impacting you then you must pay attention to that it would be helpful to explore the feelings youre having \\\\u00a0with your therapist it may be something that needs addressing to help alleviate those feelings or have a better understanding of why they are showing up when it is time for therapy\",\"it is totally normal  you have a lot riding on this and youre invested think about why you feel so shaky  is it something about the therapist or their style if so it would be a good idea to talk with them about it so you feel more at ease in any case

always brings up how i was never close to my mother\",\"Response\":[\"i am so sorry about your loss \\\\u00a0losing someone you love is always difficult however losing a mother is a significant loss in a daughters life \\\\u00a0what makes this loss complicated is that it appears you have also had a loss in your relationship with your sister \\\\u00a0it is difficult to know what happened with your sister with the limited information you have provided but what i suspect is that there are some unresolved issues between the two of you and that she may be projecting her pain on to you \\\\u00a0it is important to remember that your sister is also grieving the loss of your mother and may not be dealing with it in a very healthy way \\\\u00a0by her bringing up your relationship with your mother and suggesting that you were never close to her is her opinion \\\\u00a0only you can define and determine what your relationship was like with your mother \\\\u00a0if there is truth to this then it may be something you may need to talk about with a counselor \\\\u00a0 there could be an added layer of ambiguous loss in that you are not only grieving her physical absence but could be grieving the loss of a relationship you wish you could have had with her and the realization that you never will \\\\u00a0you and your sister are both in the heart of the grieving cycle \\\\u00a0when two people are grieving the same loss at the same time it is difficult to provide support to each other because of their own struggle even if they both were on good terms with each other \\\\u00a0depression is part of the cycle of grief \\\\u00a0it is absolutely normal to feel sad as well as experiencing other depressive symptoms ie feelings of isolation lack of motivation low energy sleep or appetite changes etc \\\\u00a0anger is another phase of the grief cycle \\\\u00a0your sister may be stuck in the anger phase not wanting to connect with her own feelings of sadness so this may be why she is being hurtful towards you in projecting her anger onto you in order to avoid the vulnerability of experiencing her own grieffinally it appears that your depression proceeded the loss of your mother and is making your experience with grief more complicated \\\\u00a0were you officially diagnosed and treated for depression prior to your loss \\\\u00a0depression in grief is different than a

lies\",\"Response\":[\"there are an infinite number of ways to look at this spirituality religion god higher power and many other parts of this discussion mean different things to different people my question for you is what does real actually mean to you often the concept of god has to do with what you believe in if you ask 1000 different people youll probably get almost that many different answersconsider talking with friends or family about this i would suggest though that you have the discussion initially with people who you trust and who you feel are willing to listen to your questions and beliefs and perhaps offer an opinion without trying to make you believe as they do you may also consider speaking with a pastor or another religious figure the local salvation army may have a link to a religious or spiritual person that leads nondenominational church services there may be able to help you to sort through this if your friends and family do not provide a comfortable environment for you related to this discussionjust a word of caution in my experience ideas of religion and spirituality can be lead to very deep discussions with some people who are very strongly connected to what they believe some people do not easily separate their own beliefs from those of others when initiating conversations about this try first asking whether someone would be comfortable discussing religion or spirituality a second question may be whether it is okay with this person you are talking to if you have different beliefs or opinionsas far as whether god is real or not

divorced they still need to figure out how to have relationship so that they can parent their child we might divorce our partners however we dont divorce our children if anything our children need to

not only decide for you when you will see your child but your child can know when you will be available just for her this will lay the foundation for consistency and allow your child to have some security in troubled timesi would highly recommend you sit down with your ex and discuss how you can both be a positive source in your childs life how you can both be there to help raise her if this

so on\\\\u00a0the best thing for your child is for you to be available and loving and doing everything possible to allow the child to be whole  a person who incorporates both parents its a tragedy for

suffering and clinging to the past especially a troubled past or a past that we dont like may be\\\\u00a0 amplified due to the christian framework that may be built into your life i am not averse to

placed in the present that means that when we stay in the moment with our partner and can notice what we are experiencing in the here and now we reap the best benefits of that relationship we notice the good things that are happening in the moment we are reacting to what we are experiencing in the moment not reacting to a worry about the past we notice especially who the person is right now and not who they were in the past \\\\u00a0we can connect with the things we love about them tooi think it is great that you want to help him and the choice to stay in the present and move forward in the relationship will mostly be up to him we cannot change another person it sounds like couples counseling might be a great step for you because you can both learn the skills you need to stay in the

what he is experiencing and you are able to listen for five 10 15 minutes in a way that is not blaming or pointing fingers or asking him to change but just listening kind of like an investigative

listen to your thoughts on the subject as wellalso if he wants to make a change it may be helpful to see a therapist who specializes in working with couples sometimes changes such as these require a

directions we could go as far as answering your question \\\\u00a0i think the first and most important question you need to ask yourself is do you truly believe in your heart that you can forgive him and trust him again \\\\u00a0once you answer that question honestly then you can move in one of two directions \\\\u00a0first if you truly love this guy and see yourself being with him long term and for the long haul so to speakand you genuinely want to forgive him and trust him again that is completely doable and possible if you both put in the work \\\\u00a0but theres a greater issue here that needs to be addressed \\\\u00a0you say your relationship is good but theres been a sexual disconnect between the two of you and that usually indicates some type of emotional disconnect is at the core \\\\u00a0would you agree with that or what are your thoughts \\\\u00a0were you giving him less sexual attention than you normally do or were you guys never on the same page about sexual needs and having compatible sex drives \\\\u00a0if you are more of an emotional person than he is you may have been less interested sexually because he hasnt been meeting your emotional needs \\\\u00a0for instance if you hadnt been feeling loved cared about validated appreciated cherished and special to him than you may have felt less connected physically and been less interested \\\\u00a0this is a common issue with couples and can easily be addressed if the communication in your relationship is strong and you can find a way to express to him your frustrations \\\\u00a0in essence many women tend to have more emotional needs than men this is the way we are hardwired and there are exceptions to this of course but if you have been feeling neglected emotionally than your lack of interest in sex is actually completely understandable and normal \\\\u00a0until he understands this and can learn to tune into your needs emotionally you may struggle with feeling you are out of sync emotionally and sexually \\\\u00a0this leads to you both being frustrated but if all this is ringing true to you he seriously probably has no clue whats going on and may not know how youre feeling \\\\u00a0you need to communicate your needs to him if you are super lost with how to do that theres an awesome book called the five love languages \\\\u00a0its not that long and its very approachable and easy to apply the concepts to your relationships invaluable resource for relationships and truly eye opening reallythis is a long post im sorry \\\\u00a0but this is such an important issue that is very common and many people feel lost about how to handle it \\\\u00a0so back to the second direction you can goyou feel very betrayed you arent sure if you can ever trust him again and you see yourself perhaps being paranoid forever and never being able to completely get over this \\\\u00a0for instance if he says he is working late or if he doesnt call or text right away when he usually does you may immediately jump to the worst case scenario that he is cheating again \\\\u00a0of course it may not be true he may have legit reasons for his behaviors but the point is if you are going to be in paranoiamode or you just will always be unsure whether he loves you and is committed to you and only you then the trust may not be able to be rebuilt \\\\u00a0you need to think long and hard about this and if you decide you have the capacity to forgive him and rebuild your foundation of trust and honesty then you need to let him know very explicitly what you need him to do to earn that trust back \\\\u00a0you cant just tell him vaguely i need to trust you again if he wants his family back and hes willing to do the work you need to line out exactly what he needs to do and he needs to do it \\\\u00a0but be prepared that he might throw out there that he cheated because he felt you werent attracted to him anymore or he tries to put the blame on you somehow because he says you werent meeting his physical needsif he throws that out there but you werent showing him the affection because you were frustrated emotionally then it all starts with you communicating that to him \\\\u00a0get that bookin conclusion if you feel in your heart there is no way you will be able to trust him again and you will always wonder if hes cheating when his behavior isnt spot on you will be a nervous wreck and perhaps cutting your losses now would spare you the continued heartache \\\\u00a0there is certainly a way to work through this but you both have to be motivated and you have to get to the source of why the cheating happened in the first place \\\\u00a0rebuilding trust can be a long process maybe even years and for some people they may never be able to fully trust and let go of the past

professional could help you strengthen your communication and ability to trust again\",\"its possible but challenging both partners need to be feel motivated enough to repair the relationship and dedicated to the work needed to address whatever underlying issues led to the serious breach of trust for some people cheating is an absolute deal breakerfor others the context of the cheating allows

being frustrated but if all this is ringing true to you he seriously probably has no clue whats going on and may not know how youre feeling \\\\u00a0you need to communicate your needs to him if you are super lost with how to do that theres an awesome book called the five love languages \\\\u00a0its not that long and its very approachable and easy to apply the concepts to your relationships invaluable resource for relationships and truly eye opening reallythis is a long post im sorry \\\\u00a0but this is such an important issue that is very common and many people feel lost about how to handle it \\\\u00a0so back to the second direction you can goyou feel very betrayed you arent sure if you can ever trust him again and you see yourself perhaps being paranoid forever and never being able to completely get over this \\\\u00a0for instance if he says he is working late or if he doesnt call or text right away when he usually does you may immediately jump to the worst case scenario that he is cheating again \\\\u00a0of course it may not be true he may have legit reasons for his behaviors but the point is if you are going to be in paranoiamode or you just will always be unsure whether he loves you and is committed to you and only you then the trust may not be able to be rebuilt \\\\u00a0you need to think long and hard about this and if you decide you have the capacity to forgive him and rebuild your foundation of trust and honesty then you need to let him know very explicitly what you need him to do to earn that trust back \\\\u00a0you cant just tell him vaguely i need to trust you again if he wants his family back and hes willing to do the work you need to line out exactly what he needs to do and he needs to do it \\\\u00a0but be prepared that he might throw out there that he cheated because he felt you werent attracted to him anymore or he tries to put the blame on you somehow because he says you werent meeting his physical needsif he throws that out there but you werent showing him the affection because you were frustrated emotionally then it all starts with you communicating that to him \\\\u00a0get that bookin conclusion if you feel in your heart there is no way you will be able to trust him again and you will always wonder if hes cheating when his behavior isnt spot on you will be a nervous wreck and perhaps cutting your losses now would spare you the continued heartache \\\\u00a0there is certainly a way to work through this but you both have to be motivated and you have to get to the source of why the cheating happened in the first place \\\\u00a0rebuilding trust can be a long process maybe even years and for some people they may never be able to fully trust and let go of the past \\\\u00a0i truly recommend starting with the book and then going from there \\\\u00a0if you decide you want to stay with him you would really benefit from couples counseling as it sounds like a professional could help you strengthen your communication and ability to trust again\",\"first off lets start with really\\\\nvalidating the potential emotional pain you are feeling right now there is\\\\ngenerally no lack of uncertainty

responsible for tracking what in fact are his responsibilities than about the anger per sewhat you describe holds the seeds of classic abusive behavior which is blaming the partner for what in fact

when doing something new especially something sexual that can feel so personal is very common indeed despite the fact that nervousness can be uncomfortable it is also part of the excitement of trying

there is something wrong with the relationship it just shows that you retain normal human emotions while in one and many people who are in polyamorous relationships have written about the work it sometimes takes to make such relationships work of course all relationships take work so polyamorous and other types of relationships are simply not an exception there could be several reasons why you are feeling the way you do one reason could be that you are simply not as comfortable with the idea as you think you are some time and good communication with your husband may help you with this another reason this may be bothering you is because on some level you are aware of the messages society gives us about marriages they are supposed to be monogamous heterosexual etc etc just because

different ways that can be approached in your situation1 i would recommend a complete medical examination including blood test i would want to know if there are any medical issues in your low sex

your past with abuse of any kind5 understand that intimacy is more than sex what other ways can you be close to your spouse6 it sounds like there is some confusion about sexual intimacy from both of youcouples counseling would be a great place to start\\\\u00a0all of these areas need to be explored before any treatment goals can be establishedyou need to talk with a professional counselor to explore how to better connect with your spouse\",\"its encouraging that you say you want to be better connected with your husband and since he hasnt left you he must care about you and the relationship more than he does about just having sex you dont say whether he complains or not but even if he doesnt it seems theres a sense of something important missing for both of youmost likely to connect better with him physically youll need to become better connected with yourself and your body men often feel fulfilled by sex simply because it happened  the woman they want received them allowed them to make love with her for women that can sometimes be more complicated a woman who loves sex most likely also loves her body knows what pleasures her and feels confident asking for what she wants selfpleasuring can be a way for you to discover more about your sexuality and a classic resource is betty dodsons book sex for one the joy of selfloving\\\\u00a0a good counselor or sex therapist can be very helpful with your whole relationship as well as the sexual part of it but not all counselors are comfortable working with sexual issues shop around and be sure you find someone who can help you and your husband get better connected on all levels\",\"the numbers you write are low compared to how much sex many other people would be satisfied havingthe key is your and your husbands satisfaction with the amount of sex you are havingand know if there are reasons besides low sex drive that possibly explain thisknowing the other possibilities matter because a low sex life may mean one of you is being satisfied sexually outside the marriage or that one of you prefers sex with a same gendered partnerif youve ruled out these possibilities and you are satisfied with your emotional and financial life in the relationship then a low sex drive may simply be the norm for the two of you\",\"there are a lot of different things that could be playing a role herefirst different people have unique levels of sex drive and sometimes there is a hormonal imbalancebecause you say both that there is a possibility that neither one of you actually knows what youre doing and you want to be better connected with your husband consider having some time where you sit together and touch each other in nonsexual ways and communicate about what you like and dont like one person would be doing the touching and the other would be communicating then the rules would switch after you both become comfortable with that you could try the same thing with touching that is sexual in naturedr

the course of your relationship is satisfying to you and your husband there is nothing wrong with it if you or your husband would like to have sex more often i suggest talking with a counselor about this to find ways to engage in a sexual life in which you are both satisfied the aspect of connectedness is an important one while sex can be very connecting for many couples it isnt the only way to connect i find that communication about the matter of frequency of sex checking in to see how you and your husband feel as well as communicant about your needs for connection are an important start to

over that i am messing around which i am not\",\"Response\":[\"im sorry to hear about the trust issues in your relationship trust as you clearly know is essential to healthy relationships past indiscretions or dishonesty can damage this trust and make it really hard to confidence that these things will not happen again despite reassurances we tend to be very sensitive to betrayal and risks to our relationship security\\\\u00a0rebuilding trust takes time and effort for both parties on your end you may need to provide more reassurance and more concrete evidence that you are trustworthy gestures of transparency eg  giving him more information about where you are going and who you will be with letting him know when you get texts or emails from people that might give him pause or trigger insecurities and more patience and empathy for his fears\\\\u00a0on his end he may need to learn to be with his insecurities and fears and ask for reassurance about your love and commitment in ways that do not lead to criticizing you attempting to control you or limiting your freedom\\\\u00a0if you are not able to come to agreements about how to put his fears to rest without it negatively impacting your life i would suggest getting some professional help from a marriage counsellor or couples therapist\",\"the good news in the way youre feeling is recognizing that your husbands trust of your actions makes a difference to youthe typical therapy formula for restoring trust between two people after some sort of betrayal is for the one who has broken the trust to earn it backrestoring trust requires both persons to actively involve themselves in this processthe person who tires earning back trust must know what standards for this of the one who was betrayedthe person who feels betrayed must willingly be open minded to accepting the efforts of the one who tries earning back their trustas simple as this formula sounds the actual process of restoring trust raises a lot of emotion on both sides therefore causing difficulty in keeping discussions in this area on trackthe best way of success in restoring trust between partners is utilizing a couples therapist who would be able to guide your conversations back on track and also open emotions for discussion when relevant to restoring trustgood luck in establishing new terms with your partner\",\"it is incredibly frustrating to not be trusted when you know you are doing nothing wrong if the lack of trust on your husbands end has to do with something you did in the past then be patient and give it time once trust is broken it takes time and effort to gain it back try seeing the situation from your husbands perspective as often times looking at situations from different angles gives us new understanding and insight remember that you cant change how he feels but you can help him to regain the trust by asking him what he needs and responding to his needs as best you can seeing a couples counselor is never a bad idea and it would also be beneficial for you and oryour husband to seek out individual therapy there may be other unknown factors that you are unaware of that are contributing to the trust issues and inability to resolve them hope everything works out for you\",\"hi louisianaits normal when trust has been broken in the past for fear and insecurities to come up from time to time his reactions may not mean that he doesnt trust you but rather that he gets scared that hes going to be hurt again\\\\u00a0youre a bit vague about the past you dont say whether you cheated or not if you did then you might try taking an approach where you a take responsibility for your past actions b show an understanding of and compassion for his pain about that c do everything you can to demonstrate trust and show that he is your priority and d reassure him when he says hes scared or feeling insecure im suggesting that part of healing is you having tolerance of his emotions and demonstrating that youre so confident you can be faithful that you can handle his moments of fear this is what he and the marriage need in order to heal from the attachment injurypart of the issue might be that when he brings it up hes coming across as angry accusing or suspicious rather than scared and insecure this often happens a therapist can help both of you understand that fear is behind the anger and it works best if he shows you his vulnerable emotions rather than the anger which is also natural but less helpful in those moments and then you can more easily recognise the cue for you to reassure him\\\\u00a0as much as you want to forget about it he might need to talk about it sometimes and thats normal his needs are important also important however is your need for respect if he approaches it in a disrespectful way thats a separate problem if its brought up as a weapon used to shut you down or used to control or punish those are unhealthy ways of dealing with past hurts you can both offer compassion to him and use your sense of boundaries to protect yourself from being flogged with the pasta qualified therapist can help you sort through this trick territory best of luck\"]}\\n{\"Context\":\"my husband had an emotional affair with his exwife in november she invited him to dinner alone with their daughter i wasnt aware of this until after 11pm when i asked where

20 years old listen to what she wants too beyond the contract youve just written up anything else you want from each other is a request its optional and whether and when you do it is at your

that she doesnt know how to recruit help for i bet your mom spends a lot of time picking up after you cleaning cooking doing laundryall those thankless mom tasks take a look at how she talks to you is she nagging about chores can you see that underneath the nagging theres a pretty overwhelmed and powerless person who needs assistance \\\\u00a0okay so my guess is that you both have a legitimate beef she wants help you want respect lets talk about how you get bothi propose that you sit down with mom and negotiate out a different sort of dynamic momi see us as stuck in how we interacted when i was fourteen can we do this differently in a way that we both get what we want sell it as winwin then you write down some things that end up forming a contract\\\\u00a0the first part is stuff thats your business and your business alone things you want your mom to respect like your room your school your job your personal relationships and hygiene moms voice has no place in these arenas unless you are storing food in your room and its a health hazard this is a mom says nothing about list\\\\u00a0the second part is about what mom needs from you what are her expectations about your role in the home as an adult does she want you to contribute to rent buy your own food do your own laundry what items can we put in your control that would take some burden off of mom how will these things be enforced what will happen if you dont follow through write it all down so its really clear it has to all be mutually agreed uponthe third part of the conversation is about how she talks to you and how you talk to her you can let her know that you dont want to be told what to do or when to do it that doesnt work when youre 20 years old listen to what she wants too beyond the contract youve just written up anything else you want from each other is a request its optional and whether and when you do it is at your discretion my guess is that if she spoke to you with more respect youd be more willing to help out and i think if you participated a bit more she would nag at you less go for the winwin\\\\u00a0i wish you well as you negotiate a new relationship with mom \\\\u00a0\"]}\\n{\"Context\":\"my

limit the amount of time you or anyone else is with your mother you can limit the caregiver burnout it is completely normal to feel what you are feeling however these are the feelings that can lead to

not you\",\"yes certainly your moms difficulty in having meaningful conversations with people results from the alzheimers disease process which weakens her brain functionfeeling a sense of guilt in

they ask or demand was for the benefit of our own survivalone way of coping with your feeling of guilt is to examine itask what it is youre feeling guilty aboutchances are that your sense of guilt is less due to what youre currently saying or doing to help your momvery likely your guilt feeling is awakening the sense of obligation that you and all of us feel toward a parent simply because parents

and emotionally now i live like a recluse and i always feel nervous around people\\\\n   how can i feel more comfortable around other people\",\"Response\":[\"theres a lot of layers there to your situation and im focusing on two layers that may be contributing to your feelings of discomfort around others\\\\u00a0 one layer is the daunting news that your son has autism\\\\u00a0 many parents can feel overwhelmed and distraught with this diagnosis\\\\u00a0 the vast array of treatments available is daunting in and of itself at times to wrap ones head around\\\\u00a0 taking time to reflect or seek out therapy regarding how this diagnosis has impacted you may be helpful\\\\u00a0 some parents feel their individual identity gets lost in the diagnosis because they have dropped everything to help their child and others may experience guilt\\\\u00a0 if either of these or other feelings come to the forefront for you it may be worth working through them with a therapist\\\\u00a0 a support group list is available through wwwautismspeaksorg and may help connect you with others raising children with autisma second layer is the abusive relationship you were involved in\\\\u00a0 the trauma you experienced in this relationship may have a very meaningful impact on your ability to trust and to be intimate with others\\\\u00a0 engaging with a therapist can help facilitate the healing process as well as paving the way for more comfortable and trusting relationships\",\"it might be helpful to have a good understanding of the why in terms of feeling nervous around people or the difficulty in developing more comfort if your discomfort is somehow related to your sons diagnosis or your lack of employment or an abusive relationship you were in and maybe embarrassed about that is important to understand and get clarity around\\\\u00a0when we can understand on a deep level what is happening for us ie where does fear come into this and whats it about we can give ourselves empathy everyone struggles in some aspect so to not necessarily think of yourself as pathological is a first step sometimes being around people can trigger an anxiety related to being good enough that goes back a ways in our history if any of the above is true it would need acknowledgement and care from you as opposed to shaming that experience in the hopes it would just go away because this experience is very real for you\",\"id wonder first if you were still in the same home and neighborhood where you raised your son and experienced the abuse in many ways we react to our environments  and if youre still surrounded by neighbors who didnt reach out when they heard your ex yelling or offer assistance and resources when your son acted differently than his peers it might make sense that youre more timid around folks it might also be worth thinking about where your bar is set do you want to be as comfortable around people as you were before your recent circumstances or find your new normal and connect only with people who raise you up and bolster your selfesteem you have the right to be both cautious if youre still surrounded by the same folks and environment and discerning  only connecting with people who will be supportive all the best\",\"it sounds like you have taken on a caretaker role for a while as well as experienced some pretty severe interpersonal trauma \\\\u00a0it

sure that he is feeling safe to share\\\\u00a0more important than if he actually had sex or not i would evaluate your relationship do you trust him now were there trust issues before does he hide

had a problem with someone but you didnt go to them to tell them you went to someone else to complain it is usually difficult for a person to confront another especially in relationships where there is a power differential for example i bet its easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaintim not saying triangulation is always a bad thing sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree thats what therapists do every day sometimes just getting someone elses perspective can help you see the issue clearer however in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem you are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you loveif you want to put a stop to this triangulation you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up even if they really dont like each other and cant get along your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle\\\\u00a0try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior it is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other these are the two most important women in your life and they both know it your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife i heard one motherinlaw describe her sons wife as the gateway to her son the wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son the wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren if your wife doesnt like her motherinlaw she can severely hamper or damage her motherinlaws relationship with you and any children you two may have from your wifes viewpoint this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to if you regularly praise your moms cooking her housework gardening or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated this can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike i am not saying that this is the case with your familys situation these are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours\\\\u00a0regardless of what the cause is if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you dont agree with them they will get upset if you dont align yourself with them against the other they will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other ones side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should in worst cases if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other ending that relationship change the dynamics before it spirals even further\"]}\\n{\"Context\":\"my wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that im doing things she finds disrespectful even when i dont mean it like that for example she gets offended when i call someone at work sweetheart  i wish i had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her  she doesnt and never will say she was wrong how do i get her to understand\",\"Response\":[\"hello that must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault this could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the longterm based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wifes side of the story i would say that you are raising 3 different concerns\\\\u00a0one is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified it may bear clarifying how each of you define infidelity currently there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hookup chatroom texting extensive phone calls to a female friend viewing pornography a massage with happy ending physical intercourse or intimate emotional sharing depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities if there is no truth to it then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying i feel you distancing from me in other words its not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her often times accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness if so what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally if this is true you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again otherwise if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needs\\\\u00a0the second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a sweetheart the term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean youre so sweet and kind my dear or in a flirtatious manner to mean sweetie the intention behind the use is known only to the speaker you may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife if your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said \\\\u00a0if she finds the term disrespectful it may be her way of expressing i want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that i am not valued as much therefore arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark rather the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings you may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you is saying sweetheart to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife that said if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding accomodating and prioritizing her needs then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities she may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fearsthe last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting shes wrong indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong in the absence of her admitting to any faults it could seem like you are the one with the problem unfortunately blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy this pattern can also trigger the partners insecurity as they witnesses the distancing which could make them angrier and more accusatory  creating a vicious cycle finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment this kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding we sometimes take for granted the simple expression of im sorry however it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that in my practice when a client tells me that his or her partner never says im sorry i am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability if neither of them express it then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesnt do it these insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation which can help couples

thoughts\",\"Response\":[\"scary thoughts can feel overwhelming at times as well as feeling quite real i want to acknowledge how scary they can feel but there is hope and new skills you can learn to work with these types of thoughts the first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them i also realize that might seem really hard to do but heres a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work thoughts arise in the mind all the time our brain is a thought machine many thoughts drift by like clouds and we dont pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way ie scary angry happy sad and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particulate thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety so how do we work or stop those scary thought streams one new skill to implement comes from the work of rick hansen he wrote the book buddhas brain he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way the brain is like velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts there are reasons that our brain works this way but i dont have time to go into all of that in this response so its just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories \\\\u00a0this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time if a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought\\\\u00a0\",\"im sorry youre going through this problem of scary thoughts in your mindnone of us are able to directly stop thoughts from comingwhat is possible is to question their value accuracy and believabilitymaybe if you examine the thoughts which upset you youll be able to feel better by understanding that the thoughts are not very relevant to your actual lifealso another choice of what to do with the upsetting thoughts is to redirect them \\\\u00a0when a stressful or frightening thought shows up in your mind give it a happy resolution \\\\u00a0 basically turn the fright into something pleasant or at least bearablei hope this helps you at least a little bit\",\"hi therei first want to let you know that having these thoughts is completely normal studies have been done that show that 80 of human thoughts are negative so you are not alone\\\\u00a0i like to think of thoughts as a tornado if you are in a tornado you are completely consumed by it and it is nearly impossible to do anything beneficial however when you are lets say a mile away from a tornado it is still scary but you have the option to do something that is important to you such as get shelter or make sure your family and friends are safe\\\\u00a0when unhelpful or scary thoughts arise we tend to start a war with them which is the equivalent of jumping into the tornado this makes the thoughts and emotions bigger and intensifies the feelings that go with them\\\\u00a0so the question i imagine you have is how do i get out of the tornado there are 3 steps to doing thisget distance from your thoughts by adding i am noticing im having the thought that to the front of them for example i am noticing i am having the thought that something bad is going to happen to me\\\\u00a0 \\\\u00a0the purpose of this is not to decrease your fear or get rid of the thought these thoughts might always be there and that is okay because that is how the mind naturally works so struggling with that is a waste of time and energy the purpose is to gain some distance from the thoughts so you dont get swept away by them you can imagine them floating along like leaves in a stream or clouds in the sky and often the same thought will come back again and again but thats okay just continue to notice it with curiosity i imagine the thoughts get in your way of doing what really matters to you so if you can get a little bit of distance you can do things that are fulfilling and meaningful to you\\\\u00a0tune into your body and notice what sensations come up and where you feel them most intensely then breathe into them and make room for them our 5 main emotions are joy sadness fearanxiety shame and anger all of these emotions are part of being human and there is no escaping them so again struggling with them ends up intensifying them instead let them be and make a little bit of room for them often a side effect of this is the intensity will decrease but it might not the purpose is to keep them from becoming more intense\\\\u00a0contact the present moment notice what is happening here and now one way of doing this is tuning into the five senses what are some things you hear see taste smell and feel another way is to notice what is happening in your body without trying to change it how deep are your breaths what is happening with your heart rate are you coldwarm etcimplementing these three steps can help you to refrain from getting caught up in your unhelpful thoughts unfortunately there is no way to get rid of thoughts or feelings completely so the only option that works in the long run is to accept them while continuing to do what matters to you and what is fulfilling to youi hope this helps\",\"such a great question im so sorry you are struggling you may be experiencing intrusive thoughts \\\\u00a0these are thoughts that seem to come from no where and victimize us \\\\u00a0i can strongly recommend a book called when panic attacks by dr david burns \\\\u00a0it helps

uncomfortable thoughts on purpose\\\\u00a0this may mean writing out in detail what the worst case fear you are thinking of is and then reading it over and over again until it becomes boring it may also mean pausing through the course of the day to merely observe all the thoughts going on and realizing that thoughts are merely thoughts they are not the same as reality and the unpleasant ones can

worked through any issues from your younger years some of our deepest scars in life are indeed invisible and suppressed we have to get to the place where we can take care of the inner child that is still hurting by recognizing that those who hurt us  however they did might have had their own challenges which prevented them from functioning and behaving in ways we might have deeply needed\\\\u00a0those who have directly hurt you may not be capable of acknowledging and understanding how you were affected by their actions  even in the worst of cases they themselves may be doing what they can either out of shame or heartbreak for their own actions to work on forgetting how they behaved toward you all those years before how are they behaving toward you now can you find it in your heart to forgive those who have hurt you forgiveness is the gift we give ourselves and isnt dependent on an apology from an offender by forgiving even in the absence of any apology we are releasing the weight of the burden we are carrying that reflects the offense we feel was committed against us sometimes therapy can be helpful in this process talking with someone who can be nonjudgmental and reflects an empathetic position toward you might be what you need right now seeking out a therapist to help you work through these negatives feelings and thoughts is much easier than

will go back to their old behaviors if they dont have something else to help them change permanently such as a new skill so guilt doesnt necessarily help us in fact as i write this someone out there

through research we know a lot of things about how to reduce anxiety ill get you started and its a great idea to connect with a therapist who can build on these ideas and get to know you wellits natural to have random thoughts that unsettle us our brains are complex wonderful things fearful and anxious thoughts are a part of this picture their purpose is to prepare us for the future and to help us make sense of the past and learn from it but what happens sometimes is that our alarm systems get out of whack and get set off too easily we often spend too much time worrying about things that happened or might happen when these thoughts take away from our enjoyment of life it becomes a problem so while fear and anxiety try to protect us they also seek power and will take any power they can getin general fear and anxiety try to tell us one or both of two things that something is wrong with us or that something bad will happen or that something bad will happen because theres something wrong with us they will use anything they can as evidence to convince you for example that person looked at you funny youre strange looking well there are dozens of possible explanations for the look on that persons face and its unlikely it had anything to do with you\\\\u00a0for you personally your thoughts are about the afterlifeabout living forever what does fear tell you will be uncomfortable about living forever what would the worst part be a therapist would help you dig deep to find the core of what you fear it might be that you have no control over who you are or where you go it might be that you fear going to hell because youre bad search for that deepest feari invite you then to picture that thought as a glass of water on a shelf its a heavy glass and if you held it in your hands for a while and stared at it it would get in the way youd be uncomfortable and unable to focus on your life thats whats happening now i suggest that the problem is not so much the thought youre having we all have random silly thoughts that usually arent true the problem is how long youre holding it in your hand you could have that thought pick up that glass a hundred times a day and as long as you put it right back on the shelf its not a problem the trick is to get it back on that shelfright now youre using distraction to do this youre trying to focus on other things around you but i think the glass is still in your hand its not enough youre looking for more tools to get that glass back on the shelf \\\\u00a0and the key is in your thoughts once you find out what fear is trying to tell you then you can talk back to fear so as an example if fear is saying to you you have no control over anything then you can work to accept the pieces you dont have control over learn to tolerate that feeling and claim back the pieces you can control you can control the extent to which you let fear take you over\\\\u00a0with a therapist you can learn to refute fears ideas you can learn to look for concrete evidence of fears lies and gain back control over your thoughts i wish you the best\",\"you need to find an outlet someone to talk to your dad or someone who loves your

now but no matter what you can talk to her\",\"religious questioning is a complex and often philosophical topic and these types of questions especially around heaven hell and an afterlife can bring up a host of difficult  confusing feelings what i want to focus on is the fear  anxiety you seem to be feeling that are deeply connected to your questions scary thoughts negative thoughts obsessive thoughts sometimes feel like theyre out of control and there is nothing we can do to stop them but i want to offer two techniques that might assist with your panic  anxiety\\\\u00a0the first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them i also realize that might seem really hard to do but heres a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work thoughts arise in the mind all the time our brain is a thought machine many thoughts drift by like clouds and we dont pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way ie scary angry happy sad and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particular thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety so how do we work or stop those scary thought streams one new skill to implement comes from the work of rick hansen he wrote the book buddhas brain he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way the brain is like velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts there are reasons that our brain works this way but i dont have time to go into all of that in this response so its just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories \\\\u00a0this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time if a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought\\\\u00a0i would also suggest when youre having the thoughts about death take a moment to notice how youre breathing often when we are feeling anxiety we are doing shallowing chest breathing rather than taking in a full deep breath or what is called belly breathing if you take a moment to focus on your breathing and allow a couple of full breaths bringing in the breath so the belly rises and then the belly natural falls as you exhale just noticing the breath and practicing breathing can slow down the anxiety cycle as it begins \"]}\\n{\"Context\":\"sometimes i cant stop thinking about life after death i was raised in a

meditation  maybe there is something like this in your religious tradition  can be very helpful in making peace with the unknown in the present moment the more we can learn to live in the moment  the less we get hung up on anticipating outcomes for our lives that may never come true mindfulness practices can help you ground be where you are  relax and regulate your nervous system so that you are able sleep and recuperate and train your attention to focus on living the life you want to live now  rather than worrying about what happens after you die\\\\u00a0having said all that  it can be profoundly helpful to speak with someone about your anxiety  especially when you feel haunted by it worry that you are crazy and cant get to sleep there are lots of good therapists out there who can help you with your anxiety\",\"hi california what youre experiencing is indeed anxiety its very common through research we know a lot of things about how to reduce anxiety ill get you started and its a great idea to connect with a therapist who can build on these ideas and get to know you wellits natural to have random thoughts that unsettle us our brains are complex wonderful things fearful and anxious thoughts are a part of this picture their purpose is to prepare us for the future and to help us make sense of the past and learn from it but what happens sometimes is that our alarm systems get out of whack and get set off too easily we often spend too much time worrying about things that happened or might happen when these thoughts take away from our enjoyment of life it becomes a problem so while fear and anxiety try to protect us they also seek power and will take any power they can getin general fear and anxiety try to tell us one or both of two things that something is wrong with us or that something bad will happen or that something bad will happen because theres something wrong with us they will use anything they can as evidence to convince you for example that person looked at you funny youre strange looking well there are dozens of possible explanations for the look on that persons face and its unlikely it had anything to do with you\\\\u00a0for you personally your thoughts are about the afterlifeabout living forever what does fear tell you will be uncomfortable about living forever what would the worst part be a therapist would help you dig deep to find the core of what you fear it might be that you have no control over who you are or where you go it might be that you fear going to hell because youre bad search for that deepest feari invite you then to picture that thought as a glass of water on a shelf its a heavy glass and if you held it in your hands for a while and stared at it it would get in the way youd be uncomfortable and unable to focus on your life thats whats happening now i suggest that the problem is not so much the thought youre having we all have random silly thoughts that usually arent true the problem is how long youre holding it in your hand you could have that thought pick up that glass a hundred times a day and as long as you put it right back on the shelf its not a problem the trick is to get it back on that shelfright now youre using distraction to do this youre trying to focus on other things around you but i think the glass is still in your hand its not enough youre looking for more tools to get that glass back on the shelf \\\\u00a0and the key is in your thoughts once you find out what fear is trying to tell you then you can talk back to fear so as an example if fear is saying to you you have no control over anything then you can work to accept the pieces you dont have control over learn to tolerate that feeling and claim back the pieces you can control you can control the extent to which you let fear take you over\\\\u00a0with a therapist you can learn to refute fears ideas you can learn to look for concrete evidence of fears lies and gain back control over your thoughts i wish you the best\",\"good questions the paradox of thinking about forever is that you can become more motivated to live only in the present thinking about forever can certainly be overwhelming its a lot to think about what can you do about your future be present  learn and relax knowing that you are doing everything you can right here right now there is a book by eckhart tolle  the power of now  that you might be interested in enjoy your journey\",\"your life here matters and being present in it so you feel joy in yourself and your surroundings is important in creating your sense of ease and balance no one can predict for sure what happens after death because consciousness transcends boundaries and limits we tend to impose on it that said if reincarnation exists or if there is a heaven or hell your consciousness of it will most likely be free of discomfort or pain as you experience it now meditating or doing selfhypnosis for anxiety can help alleviate your thoughts and sense of fear and living the a life of kindness and balance will assure that your future will be happy for you regardless of the unknown\",\"religious questioning is a complex and often philosophical topic and these types of questions especially around heaven hell and an afterlife can bring up a host of difficult  confusing feelings what i want to focus on is the fear  anxiety you seem to be feeling that are deeply connected to your questions scary thoughts negative thoughts obsessive thoughts sometimes feel like theyre out of control and there is nothing we can do to stop them but i want to offer two techniques that might assist with your panic  anxiety\\\\u00a0the first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them i also realize that might seem really hard to do but heres a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work thoughts arise in the mind all the time our brain is a thought machine many thoughts drift by like clouds and we dont pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way ie scary angry happy sad and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particular thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety so how do we work or stop those scary thought streams one new skill to implement comes from the work of rick hansen he wrote the book buddhas brain he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way the brain is like velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts there are reasons that our brain works this way but i dont have time to go into all of that in this response so its just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories \\\\u00a0this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time if a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought\\\\u00a0i would also suggest when youre having the thoughts about death take a moment to notice how youre breathing often when we are feeling anxiety we are doing shallowing chest breathing rather than taking in a full deep breath or what is called belly breathing if you take a moment to focus on your breathing and allow a couple of full breaths bringing in the breath so the belly rises and then the belly natural falls as you exhale just noticing the breath and practicing breathing can slow down the anxiety cycle as it begins\",\"you need to find an outlet someone to talk to your dad or someone who loves your mother as well is someone ideal but anyone could help just look to someone for help if you cant find anyone who you think will listen talk to your mom it can help greatly just to get the words out tell her how you feel about her passing but then also about everything else talk to her about your day tell her about happy things i dont know if youre a religious person or where you believe she is now but no matter what you can talk to her\",\"many people generate intense anxiety with obsessive thinking \\\\u00a0while the nature of your obsession about the afterlife and eternity appear very powerful and unique to you the pattern of obsessing about one thingarea is common \\\\u00a0i suggest that you consider counseling to help you with your anxiety \\\\u00a0if you are so inclined there are also medications which may bring relief \\\\u00a0obviously i cant diagnose you from one paragraph so it would be wise to visit an experienced mental health professional either a counselor or an md in your area to help you with disengaging from your selfdestructive thoughts \\\\u00a0cbt cognitive behavioral therapy is a very effective counseling approach for obsessive thinking \\\\u00a0if youd like a see a top notch cbt therapist visit wwwacademyofctorg \\\\u00a0and of course i suggest you pick up my book living yes a handbook for being human which includes cbt concepts and many more tools which will help with obsession and anxietyas for believing yourself insane or crazy this is not a mental health term but a

with other people then this advice would need to be modified for your specific strengths\",\"for some people having a sense of belonging takes some timeyou mentioned that you have an education and some basic daily needs i wonder if you may be able to look at your relationship with yourself and what makes you feel happy safe and having a sense of accomplishment if you have those feelings i wonder how you define trust and who you trustyou say you have a good time with people who are supposed to be close so i wonder what keeps them from feeling close i have also wondering if you have been emotionally hurt in the past and if so you may have some protective defenses that you use maybe on purpose maybe not to protect yourself from being hurt again remember that this idea comes in degrees where you can be more perfect in certain situations and a little less in others being emotionally protected is on a spectrum or continuum where you can make an infinite amount of adjustments or changes with different people and situationsi also wonder what it is that you want in your home and how you define it consider giving yourself permission to think about how you would define your perfect home in a world where there were no realistic restrictions such as money or location after you have that consider what parts of that you can have perhaps there is a small part that you could

it becomes to keep an emotional closeness it may be time to evaluate the situation figure out when if ever the two of you will be able to be together in person and if you can and want to wait that

something with which a client might be struggling and when it takes place in the therapy space it can be experienced and then worked throughits hard to necessarily say what some difficulties are that a counselor might encounter but i would say that not showing up like in any relationship is one of the hardest things for me and not just physically not showing up though that is certainly frustrating

not fitting in or having anything to say it is important to have a friend or two try to find someone with similar interests maybe you can do things that dont involve a lot of face to face contact like going to see a movie play or sporting event many people are perfectly happy doing things in small groups if you have ongoing conversations in your head it is usually due to worry about being judged and wanting to do or say the exact right thing as mentioned above finding someone to talk to either a supportive friend or therapist would allow you to get some of those thoughts our of your head and realize that you are more accepted than you think good luck\",\"since youre aware of your sensitivity to being among large groups of people then continue to satisfy this and stay away from crowds as

terrible relationship as it is or reach out for the support that you need to leave the abusive relationship i wish you well always\",\"this has to be very difficult to endureits pretty common for members of a couple to have different ways of resolving conflict very often one person wants to deal with the conflict right away or shortly thereafter and the other person wants to wait one thing that sometimes works is to consider having a conversation when you are not upset with one another about taking some sort of timeout and setting a timeframe for something like i cannot talk about this now but we can talk about it in two hoursmy best guess is that your boyfriend is triggered by some previous relationship either romantic or in childhood if he is aware of something that he thinks or feels when you ask him to resolve conflict or to discuss it it would be good to know what that is it could even be that hes learned to handle conflict that waysomething else you could try is to have a conversation where you each discuss what is acceptable for what is acceptable for each of you during an argument and what is not these sorts of discussions can be very difficult and you may benefit from working through them with a mental health professional who has some experience working with couplesas far as what you can do now perhaps you can remind yourself that these things have worked out before that you love him and believe that he loves you or some other statements that are true for you you may also consider finding ways to soothe yourself for example you may find that you like certain outdoor activities or reading a certain type of book or something else that gives you pleasure\",\"as you say if he does reply it is hurtful but if he doesnt reply it sounds like its just as hurtful though more in my opinion in terms of the longerrange effects on the relationship the behavior he is exhibiting would easily pass for passiveaggression as it is manipulative and controlling through passive withdrawal behaviors and i can assure you that you are not alone in struggling with how to deal with it so many do and thats why it gets done so often because it can for example if you push for connection he stonewalls even more you probably become more distressedfrankly if you and your boyfriend were sitting on my couch in therapy id likely say that the behavior needs to stop in order for the relationship to continue because of how severe it sounds an hour of withdrawal because someone cant deal is reasonable as everyone can shut down from time to time but this feels extreme and is extremely hurtful to you i might even say to him that the behavior needs to stop if he ever wants to be in a healthy loving connected relationship because the amount that you describe him disconnecting severely hurts trust and security one of the first change events in emotionallyfocused couples therapy is for the person doing the withdrawing to be able to use words and communication to help the partner understand what they are experiencing so the burden does fall more on him at the beginning it becomes the partners job to tolerate though whatever his experience isthere is no one tried and true solution to working with passiveaggression but i would most advise limitsetting like i would do in our session in one way shape or form in order for the behavior to stop there has to be consequences to it the more you tolerate it and allow him to come back to you when hes done with his silent tantrum the more you encourage the behavior because he is getting what he wants\",\"try

aspects of the day do this by creating a circle on a regular size paper do this three times ask your daughter how much of that circle can she confidently say she has under control shade that in the remaining parts of the circle are then named by intensity for example in the circle labeled school anxiety the client identified that she felt she could handle school anxiety 1 out of 4 days the circle was split into 14 14 of the circle was shaded  the remaining parts were labeled with the challenges that caused the client school anxietythese were 1 walking to class during passing time 2 not having the assignments completed or at all 3 feeling fat after labeling each part and making note of the percentage of the stress associated with each concern free form thinking takes place and a pile of unwanted behaviors and genetic responses are portrayed\\\\u00a0 around the circle in bright colors\\\\u00a0using note cards create a tree of concern the concerns can be written on note cards a concern  the behavior that leads to more trouble\\\\u00a0 for example all i could do was think about that extra slice of pizza i was unable to concentrate on the teachers explanation of the assignment

academic accomplishments however i would also want to ask her who she is as a person and encourage her to explore that with assistance from a therapistby working with a therapist your daughter will have the opportunity to discuss her stress fears and focus on achievement with an objective person as she gains a better understanding of the source of her stress and learns some stress management she

stressed that helps her to feel better if she has only unhealthy coping skills for example sleeping shuttingdown raging selfattack with critical selftalk etc or only one or two healthy skills we would want to teach her some additional healthy strategies to help her know that she can cope\\\\u00a0just one risk of not addressing this issue now could be that she may come to learn that stress is unbearable which may cause her to turn to destructive or escapist strategies to avoid the discomfort the pain of feeling hopeless andor the negative belief that she cannot help herself \\\\u00a0i definitely think it would be worth both your whiles to have her evaluated by her family doctor andor a professional counselor with a counselor specifically she could learn the needed skills as well as be evaluated for other issues that may be contributing to the issue for example a learned belief that she must be perfect or she is not worthy plus having a neutral support person to help her meet her

make critical comments be sure to validate his strong points and to recognize his natural talentspeople are much more likely to take advice if the person feels the criticism is spoken by someone who respects them and isnt only critical of themoffer your availability to talk with him if you genuinely feel available to speak with him in a nonjudgmental way\",\"i admire your efforts you can continue to offer assistance for your son but it is ultimately up to him to decide what to do with the information or ideas that you are giving to himone thing you might try is to ask questions in a way that enables you to learn more about what he is experiencing for example if he is willing to talk to you about what he does on a daily basis andor what he would like to be doing you may be able to get a

you want to get a hold of this problem relationships dont tend to last when we treat people poorly it is very possible for you to learn different ways of relating with some strong effort i would highly suggest working with a therapist and i will give you a few things to think about in the interimsometimes anger is there because we feel something is unjust or unfair but many times anger is a secondary emotion and its simply there to protect us from other more vulnerable emotions that we would rather not feel and will do anything to avoid discovering what vulnerable emotions you are protecting yourself from is important perhaps you feel powerless or unloved or unimportant it may take some time before you recognise this emotion\\\\u00a0once you do you can ask yourself about the other times in your life when you have felt that emotion where did it originate at what age did you feel too much of that feelingso much so that you cant stand it even in tiny amountsyou will learn in therapy to identify the thoughts you have that are connected to that feeling they are typically incorrect thoughts like no one lifes me or people will always hurt me fear tends to generalize and predict bad things that arent likelyyour habit is so strong that you likely have a poor sense of selfworth and you dont believe people will love youso you hurt them to keep them at a distance this happens in a subconscious level do you see how that would help you to keep people off balance or afraid or a distance away if you didnt believe in your worth so its backwards really because you think youre getting mad at people who piss you off but youre really just not wanting to face how mad you are at yourselfin addition to this work you can start to purposely treat people more kindly find out what respect is make amends and \\\\u00a0resolve to spreading peace it might sound too simple but if you act as though youre a person of peace you will start to feel more peacefulbut i hope you do

tell patients is that do you think you are depressed people often answer yes or no but many individuals respond with a question how would i know to that i often explain that if i stopped watching

experience such as when do you wake up from the dream how do you feel both emotionally and physically what are you thinking about when you wake up is there any pattern in terms of what happens to you in your waking life around the time you have this dream if you can keep a journal or a recording device to speak into by your bed you can try to record whatever you do remember and notice as soon as

of being alone fear of not being good enough all those fears can lead to low selfesteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you dont lose them the thing is controlling other people only pushes them away vicious circle right\\\\u00a0what i would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking you can start with this assignment write down all the things you think about yourself positive and notsopositive then rewrite those notsopositive things so they are positive for example thinking something like im too pushy can be rewritten as im assertive and i go after what i want it can be hard to do since we tend to get stuck in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves if you have someone you trust you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourselffinding a good cognitive therapist can help you further but if thats not an option for you right now there are lots of selfhelp books

declining health of your father family conflict as well as trying to balance a work and school schedule stress if left unchecked has many negative health related implications first and foremost i would recommend going to see a counselor at your collegeuniversity most colleges have counseling centers for students that usually allow for 56 free counseling sessions your tuition actually pay for these sessions so take advantage of them secondly i would advise you to take a minute and breathe when confronted with overwhelming life issues it is common to busy ourselves in an attempt to distract ourselves from the drama but sometimes that can compound our stress when dealing with stress it is important that you engage in self care in other words find time to engage in activities that bring you a sense of peace enjoyment and fulfillment in order that you may get a momentary release from your daily hectic life even with a normal life there is no way to escape stress it is inevitable and a part of life but how you deal with stress as well as how you take care of yourself in the midst of these whirlwind events will determine your quality of life i hope this helps\"]}\\n{\"Context\":\"im

relationship to another without giving ourselves a chance to adjust and grieve for the one we had to leave behind when you find yourself in a situation where a previous partner is coming back into

relationship do you feel the same way about this returning relationship as you did before it was ended how long andor how committed is the current relationship you are in now with your current partner does your former partner not like being dumped and maybe they just want to get back together with you so that they can dump you instead some of these questions you may not be able to answer and some of them might require your own internal reflectionyou likely want to make a good decision and you also might want to consider who it will impact and how that will happen other friends might be upset at this sudden change and it could create a strain on your friendship you will want to carefully consider the value of that friendship before you take any actions that could damage it also perhaps think about what led you to end the relationship with your previous partner in the first place has there been a change in events or behavior that would cause you to think of a valid reason to give that person a second chance how it will it impact your current relationshipgoing into relationships should be done with reflection patience and full awareness ultimately you choose who is in your life so you want to make those choices based on appropriate decision making and with the ability to protect yourself from harm no one else can make this choice for you however gaining the insight of friends or family can be helpful as can seeking out the counsel of a therapist in your heart you will likely find the right answer learn to trust that more as that is where the core of emotion tends

with anything to avoid fighting as far as dates if i dont say anything plan it or have money to chip in we will not go i feel like i put in a lot of work supporting and sometimes spoiling and all i get is a loyal man who will not cheat and say sweet things on occasion\",\"Response\":[\"well then your decision is whether you want to stay in this type of relationship or notone point to keep in

dad cheated on my mom for 13 years i cannot stop obsessing over the fact that my boyfriend might be cheating on me even when i know he isnt i have full access to his phone social media and emails i never find anything but im obsessed with constantly checking just in case how do i stop this its driving a wedge between us\",\"Response\":[\"hi greenville i respect that youre owning your own overreactions and that you want to give your boyfriend the respect he deserves the truth is that some people cheat and some dont and our partners deserve the benefit of the doubt unless they show signs they cant be trustedthe answer here is in two different areas basically if you want to feel differently more trusting in your case you look at your thoughts and your behavioursyour thoughts are stuck like tires in deep ruts in the road these thoughts are only habits they dont reflect the truth fear is probably whispering in your ear things like everyone cheats or  youre not enough for him once you figure out what fear is trying to tell you picture those words in red next time they come up ask yourself what the evidence is that supports that thought there wont be muchperhaps none and what is the evidence that doesnt support it i know lots of good men i know i deserve love and loyalty there is no sign of infidelity youre learning to refute the thoughts that are connected to the fear thats the first half practise these thoughtsthe rest of the work is in your behaviours act as though you trust him force yourself to not check or interrogate and the less you check the less obsessive and untrusting you will feel acting as if something if true strangely helps us believe itits possible to change the way we think and this is turn changes the way we feel try this to start and see a therapist for support and cognitive behavioural therapy if you want to dive more deeply into why this is happening and how to stop it good luck\"]}\\n{\"Context\":\"my dad doesnt like the

couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates i needed professional help for my stress because i was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates after that i was fine for a couple of years i entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work i believe my depression rebooted from there with the stress i began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her obviously that wasnt the right choice i regret ever doing that seeing as even though im not selfharming anymore i always look back at that time whenever i feel very stressed i have a big problem with handling problems in life whenever a problem arises i get stressed and i feel hopeless as if its not going to get better i get way too stressed from my problems which leads to overreacting a lot especially when talking to others which then leads to depression i have a hard time coping with stress because i know that if i could handle it easily then i wouldnt be sad all the time and i would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones\",\"Response\":[\"i couldnt help but notice that you did not specify your age so i am unable to set the total chronological order and length that you have suffered in this way but i want to

were able to curb those before they caused too much harm\\\\u00a0from what you have written stress has always been a difficult thing for you to manage \\\\u00a0often when i am working with those who offer the same concern there is a degree of people pleasing that comes with that stress \\\\u00a0when we are trying to make others happy especially when we are unable to distinguish the proper rules for success it can make even the simplest of tasks overwhelming\\\\u00a0stress management is just that management of our own anxieties about the needs of others about our skills and the ability to complete a task and having multiple requests at any given time each of these aspects requires a separate sets of tools to manage them accordingly for example assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties try to separate the different areas of the problem in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time\\\\u00a0perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your lesshelpful responses to stress for example does a certain persons style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity \\\\u00a0is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirementstry to ask yourself

the harm it is doing is more that the pleasure it brings you is there a benefit to being in this relationship do you consider this situation to be for your highest good is it healthy to be involved in something that is not likely healthy or perhaps could even be seen as dysfunctional in truth only you can decide the answers to these very important questions i would encourage you to think of who benefits by being in this situation and how you might be able to find happiness in other relationships that are healthier and more positive in my clinical view based on what i read this particular relationship does not carry the joy i am sure you want nor the healthy interactions you would expect in a functional romantic engagement with another personbeating yourself up about potentially wasting all this time waiting for the other person to come around will not serve a positive purpose it likely will only lower your selfesteem there is a time to wait to see how things develop and a time to move on to other experiences you are the one to make that choice but i would encourage you to connect with your inner higher self for the most clear answer chances are you already know the

deserves from a man she is always telling me that she deserves this and that from a man it makes me feel like crap because i cannot give her everything that she wants she told me one time that she wants a man who is going to be afraid to lose her is that a normal thing that women want or should i just move on already i am in my 30s and she is in her 40s\",\"Response\":[\"love is not enough to

in a place where you can decide when is best to talk about something that is important it may also be helpful to ask if you could talk for two or three minutes to make a point and then have space for her to talk for the same amount of time you can adjust the timing for what works for both of you after one of you is talking perhaps you could restate what you have heard the person say this can lessen confusioni know you say that she avoids it it might be a good place to start talking about it  to see what makes her avoid it it could be that she thinks any discussion about them is going to lead to an argument or you saying that she cant talk to them i dont know how you typically react when you are jealous but if you can discuss talking about this in a way that you are both open to hearing what the other person is experiencing that may be helpful as well\"]}\\n{\"Context\":\"my girlfriends grandma passed away 5 months ago they were very close she took care of her till she died

away you can address and reduce your own anxiety about the possibility of her asking by reassuring yourself that you have the right as parents to make this decision and that if shes offended that doesnt mean that youre being mean it means that she has unrealistic expectations so the first goal is to put it out of your mind as a worry you might never have to face that moment but i understand that you want to be preparedas her son perhaps your husband is the best one to answer the question should it ever come is he willing to do this but if you are comfortable and if youre the one she asks you can confidently give her a simple honest response about why it wont happen and i would suggest presenting a firmly closed door rather than saying but maybe later no need to apologize or hum and hawwe love that you want to be around junior and we definitely want you in hisher life try to leave out the but here youre not in a healthy place and were not comfortable with you caring for himher on your ownif she pushes the issue this is evidence of her denial or inappropriate boundaries id let her know that its not negotiable that you understand if shes disappointed but youre not open to discussing the issue really theres nothing to discuss learning not to take responsibility for her emotions is part of having an ill person in your life i wish you the best\"]}\\n{\"Context\":\"my new

example my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing my mother would complain my wife is lazy\\\\r\\\\nhowever its intensified lately i think the cause is my wife talked back to her once now any little disagreement is magnified leading to major disagreements what can i do\",\"Response\":[\"what you are describing is something psychologists have termed triangulation which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead you have been triangulated by your wife and motherthis is often seen in families its seen everywhere how many times have you had a problem with someone but you didnt go to them to tell them you went to someone else to complain it is usually difficult for a person to confront another especially in relationships where there is a power differential for example i bet its easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaintim not saying triangulation is always a bad thing sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree thats what therapists do every day sometimes just getting someone elses perspective can help you see the issue clearer however in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem you are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you loveif you want to put a stop to this triangulation you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up even if they really dont like each other and cant get along your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle\\\\u00a0try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior it is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other these are the two most important women in your life and they both know it your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife i heard one motherinlaw describe her sons wife as the gateway to her son the wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son the wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren if your wife doesnt like her motherinlaw she can severely hamper or damage her motherinlaws relationship with you and any children you two may have from your wifes viewpoint this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to if you regularly praise your moms cooking her housework gardening or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated this can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike i am not saying that this is the case with your familys situation these are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours\\\\u00a0regardless of what the cause is if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you dont agree with them they will get upset if you dont align yourself with them against the other they will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other ones side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should in worst cases if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other ending that relationship change the dynamics before it spirals even further\"]}\\n{\"Context\":\"my wife is trying to leave she agreed to come back and give me a little time even said she

likely is it to be a positive experience do you have any contact with the parent you may want to speak with the parent first to determine whether they are in a stable enough place to allow this to happen \\\\u00a0i would start by asking the child more about what is on his mind what does he want to get out of a visit with the parent is it to see them and know the parent is okay to get an apology to apologize for a perceived hurt to have regular contact to find out if they are loved what does he hope mom or dad might do or say in the visit there are many possible goals this child might have in mind this will give you a sense of whats missing for the child what need are they trying to fill once you know the need try to determine the likelihood of that need being met successfully through
